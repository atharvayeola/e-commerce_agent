Why trust us?\n\nThe  iPhone  17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  have arrived , in a trio of colors including a stunning Cosmic Orange, and in the case of the Pro Max,  the most expensive iPhone variant ever .\n\nApple has drastically overhauled the design of its Pro series handsets, with a super-sized \u2018plateau\u2019 (camera bump to you and me) on the rear, along with a new metal unibody and even tougher ceramic.\n\nPrices start at $1,099 and $1,199 respectively, which bags you 256GB of storage \u2013 matching the cost of the  iPhone 16 Pro  and Pro Max when they launched in 2024. But can the price tag still be justified? Well, here\u2019s seven iPhone 17 Pro features worth talking about.\n\nApple spent a lot of time during its launch event talking about how it\u2019s improved the durability across its entire range, including the  iPhone 17  and  iPhone Air .\n\nFor the Pro duo, there\u2019s an all-new \u201cheat-forged aluminum unibody\u201d which wraps around the back and incorporates the raised \u2018plateau\u2019 which houses the cameras and a bunch of components.\n\nThis tough aerospace-grade 7000-series aluminum alloy unibody is complemented by Apple\u2019s new Ceramic Shield 2 on the front and on a section of rear of the handset.\n\nApple claims the rear ceramic is four times more resistant to cracks than \u201cthe glass back of previous-generation iPhone\u201d, while the front protection is three times more scratch resistant \u201ccompared with previous-generation iPhone.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max feature Apple\u2019s new A19 Pro chipset with 6 CPU and 6 GPU cores, delivering up to 40% better sustained performance versus the iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nThese phones are capable of handling local AI models with more efficiency, and it\u2019s part of an overall package Apple says is \u201cdesigned from the inside out to be the most powerful iPhone models ever made.\u201d\n\nAnother feature which helps the iPhone 17 Pro duo offer game-changing performance is the inclusion of a vapor chamber \u2013 a first for an iPhone.\n\nApple\u2019s implementation features deionized water sealed inside a chamber and laser-welded to the chassis, which helps dissipate heat from the A19 Pro chipset, keeping components cooler, and allowing for improved sustained performance.\n\nIn real-terms, that means longer gaming sessions, more 4K video capture, and AI modelling to your hearts content, without having to hold a hot potato.\n\nApple has improved the zoom capabilities on the rear cameras for the iPhone 17 Pro handsets.\n\nApple\u2019s longest telephoto lens ever offers you up to an 8x optical zoom \u2013 the longest ever on an iPhone.\n\nThis allows you to get closer to your subject without any loss in image quality. And if you want to get even closer, the new phones also support up to 40x digital zoom\n\niPhone battery life has been a bit of a running joke through the years, and while Apple has improved efficiency with each generation, you\u2019d be hard pushed to say it offers phones with the best battery life.\n\nBut with the iPhone 17 Pro Max, Apple claims the best battery life ever for an iPhone with up to 39 hours of video playback from a single charge. The 17 Pro claims a still-impressive 33 hours.\n\nApple\u2019s also improved charging, with a 20 minute charge from a high-wattage adapter (you\u2019ll need at least a 30W plug) replenishing up to 50% of the battery.\n\nDid you manage to catch the Apple event livestream? If you didn\u2019t, we\u2019d recommend you go back and  give at least some of it a watch . Why? Because the whole thing was shot on an iPhone 17 Pro.\n\nApple\u2019s equipped the Pro series with even more video features, including enhanced video stabilization, cinema-grade specs, and compatibility with industry-standard workflows. It reckons it can be used for Hollywood productions as well as your home-movies. I shopping eBay for my director\u2019s chair right now.\n\nThe screen has also been given an upgrade, with peak brightness now at a dazzlingly 3,000 nits \u2013 a significant improvement over the 2,000 nits peak brightness on the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\n\nIt means the displays on the 6.3-inch iPhone 17 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 17 Pro Max should be even better to view in bright light, plus Apple has applied a new anti-glare coating to further improve the viewing experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re tempted by the iPhone 17 Pro or iPhone 17 Pro Max, pre-orders for the phones open on September 12. Both handsets will be available online and physically in stores from September 19.\n\nSoon after the iPhone 17 Pro hit the shelves, numerous images and videos popped up on the internet showing scratches on the phone's rear shell. There was widespread speculation that the scratches were due to the aluminum material underneath, which is leading to scuff marks. Apple, it seems, has a rather low-cost solution to avoid the ugly problem.\n\nThe surprising fix\n\nFor all those who buy the very best phones, many customers opt for more affordable flagships, typically priced at or below $1,000.\n\nThis year, the competition has been fierce for the $800 mark, with Samsung launching the Galaxy S25 in January. Last month, Google followed with the Google Pixel 10 \u2014 complete with a new telephoto lens \u2014 and earlier this month, Apple showcased its vision for the $800 mark with the revamped Apple iPhone 17.\n\nWhen's the last time you used a phone or gadget that you just couldn't put down? For me, it was the Galaxy Z Fold 7 a few months ago, with Samsung's ultra-thin folding phone proving that the best folding phones can be as thin as regular phones when folded.\n\nBefore the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung tested the form factor with the non-folding Galaxy S25 Edge. Measuring just 5.8 mm thick, it demonstrates that a strong flagship experience can be achieved in an ultra-thin body, provided you're willing to accept certain compromises.\n\nUpgrade your lifestyle Digital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.", "excerpt": "Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.
