And many are on sale right now during Amazon Prime Day.\n\nCNET staff -- not advertisers, partners or business interests -- determine how we review products and services. If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nvs\n\nThe Lenovo Legion 5i Gen 10 is the newest addition to the list. Its RTX 50 series GPU delivers great performance for the price, and what puts it over the top is its bright, crisp OLED display. Though it's a great pick for gamers, it's more than just a gaming laptop.\n\nI\u2019ve also got favorites across a broad range of categories, from sleek, long-lasting ultraportables and MacBooks to the best two-in-one and business laptops I\u2019ve tested this year. And you'll find many  laptops on sale  during  Amazon Prime Days .\n\nApple\u2019s already fantastic laptop is now faster and cheaper. The MacBook Air recently received a jolt with an update to Apple\u2019s latest M4 silicon, and its price dropped by $100. The  13-inch MacBook Air M4  starts at $999, and the  15-inch MacBook Air M4  starts at $1,199. Each provides a ton of value for the money.\n\nThe larger Air is still thin and light while supplying a roomy 15.3-inch display. It\u2019s the best laptop for most people. The smaller and lighter Air sacrifices some screen size for increased portability, making it the  best student laptop . You can go wrong with either, and both are $200 off for Amazon's Prime Day.\n\nA Windows rival to the MacBook Air has arrived in the form of Microsoft's first  Copilot Plus PC . Based on a  Qualcomm Snapdragon X  CPU, the  Surface Laptop 7  offers strong application and AI performance and outstanding battery life. It was the first Windows laptop I've tested with a longer battery life than that of the MacBook Air. With a design that's on par with the Air's, the Surface Laptop 7 is one of the best laptops. So is the  Asus Zenbook A14 , which is a lightweight laptop with an even longer battery life than the Surface Laptop 7.\n\nRead more :\n\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air is proof that you don't need a Pro to get a larger display. It supplies a larger screen that you once found only on the pricier Pro models. If you're eyeing the 14- or 16-inch Pro models primarily for the added screen size, the MacBook Air 15 is the more affordable option you should go for, especially at its new lower starting price.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe roomy, 15.3-inch display is powered by Apple's M4 chip and 16GB of RAM. The M4 update adds incremental improvements -- and a new sky blue color -- to an already fantastic laptop that sits in the Goldilocks Zone of Apple's MacBook lineup.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nPeople looking for a big-screen MacBook who don't need the power of a MacBook Pro. With its roomy display, trim design and new lower starting price, the 15-inch M4 MacBook Air should be viewed as the default Air, with its cheaper and smaller 13-inch sibling a good alternative for students and others with tighter budgets and busy, on-the-go lifestyles.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nStudents who need a more affordable and portable laptop will be better off with the 13-inch Air. Creative types who need more graphics oomph will need to spend more for the added power of a MacBook Pro.\n\nCNET\u2019s editors recommend the M4 15-inch MacBook Air as the best overall laptop and the M4 13-inch MacBook Air as the best laptop for students. You can get them for less right now during Best Buy\u2019s MacBook sale. Take up to $300 off any MacBook model with an M2 chip or newer, which means you can get a new MacBook now, built for Apple Intelligence, for as low as $699.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 reverses earlier Arm-based efforts that were plagued by lackluster performance and limited compatibility. Many x86 apps were unable to run on an Arm-based system. This time around, performance has improved and so has compatibility.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nI like it for its polished design and class-leading battery life. The Surface Laptop 7 ran for nearly 20 hours in testing -- that\u2019s the longest of any 13- or 14-inch laptop I've ever tested -- including the M4 MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop 7 competes with the MacBook Air in performance and battery life and supplies a similarly sleek and solid build.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nPeople who love the look and long battery life of the MacBook Air but want a Windows laptop. We wish there were an OLED display option, and you\u2019ll need to conduct a compatibility check for your mission-critical applications before embracing the Arm-based Surface Laptop 7. However, if you can overcome these hurdles, you\u2019ll get a well-built, good-looking, and long-lasting Windows ultraportable. You don't necessarily need to spend the roughly $2,000 that our test system costs; one of the lower-priced configurations on sale for $1,250 at Amazon should meet the needs of most people.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nAnyone worried about potential Windows-on-Arm compatibility issues should consider skipping Qualcomm-based laptops and opt for an Intel or AMD model instead. The Surface Laptop 7 is also not the pick if you want an OLED display on your next laptop. For more, check out my other  favorite Windows laptops .\n\nThe Lenovo Legion 5i Gen 10 is overkill for most budget gaming laptop shoppers, both in terms of price and features. But if you view it as two laptops in one -- a competent gaming laptop with a reasonably large 15.1-inch display and a general-use laptop that's thin and light enough to carry around more than occasionally -- then its price north of $1,500 begins to look like a great value.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nIt provides great performance for the price, and the 2.5K OLED display is outstanding. The Legion 5i Gen 10's OLED wins the Triple Crown for displays: a high resolution for crisp text and images, a speedy refresh rate for smooth movement and a high peak brightness that allows colors to pop. It's one of the best laptop displays I've ever seen.\n\nWho it\u2019s best for\n\nIt's a great pick for gamers, but it's more than just a gaming laptop. Creators engaged in color-accurate work will love the bright, high-res OLED display and the laptop's portability relative to other gaming laptops.\n\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it\n\nIf you need a portable laptop with good battery life, then most gaming laptops, including this one, are the wrong choice.\n\nFor Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Air, the bigger news than moving from Apple's M3 silicon to M4 chips is the drop in price.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nStarting at $999, the MacBook M4 Air is $100 cheaper than the entry point for the previous M3 models. In addition to a slight bump in performance over the previous generation, the M4 Air adds a Center Stage webcam, better support for external displays and a new ice blue color option.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nThe M4 chip refresh adds up to a good, if minor, update to an already fantastic lightweight laptop that\u2019s now more affordable for students and those on tight budgets. With its mix of strong overall performance, long battery life and a trim design, it\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s such a popular laptop for students.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nAnyone who is buying a MacBook Air for toting around the house instead across campus will enjoy the roomier display of the 15-inch Air. Also, graphics pros who need the power of a Pro will need to spend more for a 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nThe ProArt P16 boasts a big, beautiful 16-inch 4K OLED alongside enough graphics horsepower to deliver the performance in Adobe and CapCut that creators crave inside a reasonably slender, lightweight chassis.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe ProArt P16 series is built around a powerful AMD Strix Point processor, the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. Our P16 test system also features an RTX 5070 GPU from Nvidia's latest series along with an ample 32GB of RAM and a roomy 2TB SSD, a welcome inclusion for video editors and gamers who tend to require capacious storage. The port selection is fairly standard, but includes an SD card slot -- something creators will appreciate.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nCreators and media editors. The ProArt P16 is an extremely capable workday companion that can also double as a suitable gaming machine for anything short of 4K.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nGamers looking to squeeze out the highest frame rates possible from an RTX 5070 laptop.\n\nBuilt around an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor, the Zenbook A14 is the lightest Copilot Plus PC we've tested and the second-longest running. It weighs less than 2.2 pounds and offers a battery life of more than 24 hours.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nIts Ceraluminum shell allows the Zenbook A14 to be incredibly light yet rigid, and its 14-inch OLED display is excellent. It also serves up ample RAM and storage for the price.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nStudents and anyone who is on the road with regularity for their job. If portability is paramount, then the lightweight, long-running Zenbook A14 is the pick.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nIf you are concerned about Windows-on-Arm compatibility issues, then you should skip the Zenbook A14 and find an Intel- or AMD-based laptop.\n\nThis recent release from Acer's budget Aspire line is based on an  Intel Lunar Lake  CPU. Its Intel Core Ultra 5 226V features a neural processing unit (NPU) capable of 40 trillion operations per second ( TOPS ) for local AI processing, which happens to be the minimum requirement for  Microsoft's Copilot Plus PC platform . The Aspire 14 AI is on sale for $619 at Amazon and only $500 at Costco, making it easily the cheapest Copilot Plus PC I've reviewed.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe Aspire 14 AI a great pick among budget laptops. Its performance and battery life exceed what you can expect for the price and the design is nearly the same as you get with Acer's more expensive Swift models. You're forced to sacrifice display quality to hit such a low price but that's an item that's usually not very high on a budget shopper's priority list. More important is getting a modern CPU that delivers sufficient performance for everyday use that's also efficient to allow for lengthy battery life -- plus a bit of future-proofing with its AI capabilities.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nWith the lengthy battery life we've come to expect from Copilot Plus PCs and with application and AI performance that's competitive with pricier models, the Aspire 14 AI offers great value for budget shoppers looking for a Copilot Plus PC.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nIf you care about the overall look of your next laptop and have the money, you can find more exciting designs. Spending more will also get you a brighter display with better color performance.\n\nWith its excellent build quality, adequate display, strong performance and lengthy runtime, the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 provides a ton of value and is a great fit as a versatile machine for home use or students.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nIt's a great deal at its price of $900 at Best Buy and an even better deal at its regularly discounted price of $800 direct from Lenovo. We like its solid, all-metal chassis and the power and efficiency you get from its AMD Ryzen 7 8000-series CPU.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nAnyone looking for a flexible two-in-one for a great price, including students who might like to take notes in tablet mode. It lacks some of the refinement and extras you get with  Lenovo\u2019s flagship Yoga 9i 14 , but the midrange Yoga 7 14 is much more affordable. We think it's the better option for most people.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nLaptop buyers who want a lighter two-in-one with a better OLED display and better speakers -- and are willing to spend more to get those extras -- should instead consider the Yoga 9i 14.\n\nThe Zephyrus G16 that my colleague, Lori Grunin, reviewed is relatively pricey at $2,700 for an upscale configuration with a 16-inch OLED screen, RTX 4080, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD and an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe ROG G16 configuration that Lori tested isn't cheap but it's a good all-around system for both gaming and creative work. She liked the huge, calibrated OLED display and performance from the pairing of the Core Ultra 9 CPU and RTX 4080 graphics. The port selection was also a positive.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nGamers who want a large screen for a more immersive gaming experience, and creators who will make use of the calibrated OLED display. Solid configurations start at $2,000, so you don't need to spend as much as the model we reviewed. If you have a smaller budget, then take a peek at our picks for  best cheap gaming laptop .\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nThe Zephyrus G16 is a great choice for gamers, but its little sibling -- the G14 -- is a little more highly rated because of its more general-use advantages, which include size, weight and lower price.\n\nIf you love the sleek look and great portability of a MacBook Air but need a Windows laptop for work, then HP's flagship EliteBook Ultra is a great alternative.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nWith a spectacular 14-inch, 2.8K OLED display wrapped up in an elegant and compact enclosure, the EliteBook Ultra G1i deserves its Ultra label. It definitely has a premium look and feel that's on par with a MacBook Air in terms of being thin and light yet rigid and sturdy. Its Intel Lunar Lake CPU is a well-rounded performer with great efficiency for good battery life that'll get you through almost any workday on a single charge.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nWith its compact chassis and deluxe design, the EliteBook Ultra G1i is well suited for traveling executives or anyone who appreciates a small, lightweight OLED laptop for work.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nAnyone who can't wait for it to go on sale or isn't purchasing at a quantity that qualifies for a volume-pricing discount should take a pass. At its sale price of $1,899 or $1,999, the EliteBook Ultra G1i is an excellent value and a great choice for your next work laptop, but it's harder to recommend at its full price of nearly $3,000.\n\nThis 14-inch Chromebook Plus model delivers good performance and even better battery life, along with a respectably bright display with a matte finish to limit glare. And it has more storage than you'd typically find at its price. The model we reviewed lacked keyboard backlighting, which was a bit of a bummer, but Acer does sell models with a backlit keyboard that aren\u2019t that much more expensive. With its mix of features and performance for the price, it\u2019s easy to recommend the Acer Chromebook Plus 514 for school, work or home.\n\nSee the pricing and specs for our favorite laptops.\n\nFollowing on the heels of the Legion 5i Gen 10, I\u2019m currently testing two more budget gaming laptops, the HP Omen 16 and Lenovo LOQ 15. Each features an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU and RTX 5060 graphics. Look for those full reviews later in October.\n\nAlienware Aurora 16 : I tested two Alienware Aurora gaming laptops, and this is not the one to get.\n\nAlienware Aurora 16X : This is the Aurora to get.\n\nAcer Nitro V 16S AI : This budget gaming laptop serves up a big screen and big value.\n\nMSI Katana 15 HX : I liked its 1080p performance but little else.\n\nHP OmniBook X Flip 16 : While it has a handful of appealing features, this midrange 16-inch convertible ends up being a clumsy assemblage of disparate parts.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition : It offers a cheap path to an OLED ultraportable, but is a ThinkPad a ThinkPad without the little red nub in the middle of the keyboard?\n\nHP OmniBook X Flip 14 : This two-in-one laptop offers style, value and configuration options abound, including a 3K OLED display for only an extra $100.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop (13-inch) : It\u2019s compact, solidly built and great for travel, but the 13.8-inch version is the better choice as your daily driver.\n\nDell 14 Plus : Skip the two-in-one and opt for the clamshell laptop I tested, when it goes on sale.\n\nAcer Swift Go 16 (2025) : Built around a beautiful 16-inch OLED screen, the latest Swift Go 16 improves on its predecessors without significant price inflation.\n\nDell 16 Plus 2-in-1 : This big-screen, mini-LED convertible laptop certainly has some positives, but there are a few too many negatives to give this Plus a full-throated recommendation.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition : It\u2019s a great business laptop, but it can get pricey fast with upgrades.\n\nAcer Swift 14 AI : This midrange Copilot Plus PC offers incredible battery life but is missing one key feature.\n\nHP EliteBook X G1a : X does not mark the spot for this biz laptop when the Ultra version costs roughly the same and supplies a far better display inside a slimmer, more compact design.\n\nLenovo Yoga Slim 9i 14 Gen 10 : It's ultrastylish and ultracompact, but maybe don't hide the camera behind the display next time?\n\nAcer Chromebook Plus 516 : The 16-inch display provides plenty of room to work but Acer has a similar model that offers more for less.\n\nHP Pavilion Plus 14 (2025) : Parts of the HP Pavilion Plus 14 are great but there's one poor-quality feature that totally ruins the experience.\n\nAcer Swift 16 AI : It's thin. It's light. It's long-running. And it boasts a big, bright 16-inch OLED display. So what's holding this Copilot Plus PC back from being more than just a big-screen productivity machine?\n\nThe review process for laptops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments.\n\nWe test all laptops with a core set of benchmarks, including\u00a0 Primate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6 ,\u00a0 Cinebench R23 ,\u00a0 PCMark 10 , a variety of\u00a0 3DMark \u00a0benchmarks (whichever can run on the laptop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported) and our own battery life test. If a laptop is intended for PC gaming, we'll also run benchmarks from\u00a0 Guardians of the Galaxy ,\u00a0 The Rift Breaker \u00a0(CPU and GPU) and\u00a0 Shadow of the Tomb Raider .\n\nFor the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price.\n\nThe list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on our\u00a0 How We Test Computers \u00a0page.\n\nAn Amazon sale is a great time to find a laptop at a great price, and a  Prime Day sale  is happening right now. It takes place Tuesday, Oct. 7 and Wednesday Oct. 8 and we've found great deals on  laptops ,  tablets ,   TVs ,  headphones  and as well as devices from  Apple  and  Amazon itself .  Best Buy  and  Walmart  are also each running competing sales right now.\n\nOther times of the year when you can find the best laptop deals are during back-to-school sales in late summer or early fall and a bit later in the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. You can find discounts on laptops throughout the year but, if you're looking for the best deal and can afford to wait, these are typically the best times to buy one.\n\nApple\u2019s MacBooks are the most popular laptops and for good reason. They offer excellent build quality and leading performance and battery life ever since Apple introduced its M series processors in 2020.\n\nThe top two brands on the Windows side are Lenovo and HP. Both offer a wide variety of models, from thin-and-light ultraportables to larger, more powerful models for gaming content creation. Lenovo\u2019s ThinkPads have long been a favorite among business laptops and its Yoga models are usually highly rated two-in-one laptops.\n\nHP is in the middle of a branding transformation . It's ended its Pavilion, Envy and Spectre laptop brands in favor of OmniBook consumer models and EliteBook business models. Its Omen brand will continue as the home", "excerpt": "These are the best laptops that my colleagues and I have reviewed in the past year, spanning all types, sizes and prices.
