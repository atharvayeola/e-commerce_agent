Most support texting, calls, voice assistants, maps,  fitness tracking , tap-to-pay and more. For many folks at NBC Select, a smartwatch is an essential wearable that enhances our everyday life.\n\nBut the best smartwatch for you is almost entirely decided by which smartphone is in your pocket. Many of the best smartwatches only work with iPhone or Android phones, not both. Some even have features that only work when paired with a specific type of smartphone. Smartwatches are often tailor-made to a specific smartphone, like a square peg built for a square hole, working in tandem to deliver the best experience possible.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve tested over a dozen smartwatches using Apple, Samsung and Google phones. Below, you\u2019ll learn about how smartwatches work and where each brand excels. There\u2019s also a batch of new smartwatches that each brand has released, which we plan on testing soon.\n\nMost NBC Select staffers use a smartwatch \u2014 either for notifications, exercise or sleep tracking. Combining their experience with my time testing, we selected smartwatches keeping the following in mind:\n\nI\u2019ve tested over a dozen smartwatches for NBC Select. I am a runner and cyclist, and often use them to track and monitor stats like heart rate, pace and time. I am also the tech reporter at NBC Select, so I tend to spend hours tinkering with product settings, exploring what a product offers out of the box and what I can fine-tune later.\n\nI receive smartwatches from different brands, and test each watch for at least a week, using as many of the features as possible. I pair each watch with either an Apple, Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel smartphone, depending on its compatibility.\n\nWant more from NBC Select?  Sign up  for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nMost of our top overall picks come from Apple, Samsung and Google, companies that make up a  large majority of smartphone sales  in the U.S. All of our top picks have very similar features \u2014 they can all send and receive texts, make calls, use a voice assistant, track health and wellness metrics, log workouts, use apps, find your phone and more.\n\nOur budget picks are slightly more limited \u2014 some cannot answer calls or lack an on-watch keyboard to type out texts. We discuss all of these limitations in each recommendation.\n\nWe linked to the Wi-Fi versions of these devices, but many of them also have Wi-Fi plus cellular versions that, when set up with their own phone plan, can do most tasks without being connected to your smartphone.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note : I\u2019m currently testing the latest  Apple Watch Series 11 , which launched on September 19th. We may update this pick after I finish testing.\n\nDespite constantly testing new smartwatches, the  Apple Watch Series 10  stubbornly remains on one of my wrists, at the very least to compare to other smartwatches. The Series 10 model has a large, square, always-on display, with narrow bezels (the frame that borders the screen). The watch\u2019s form-factor means it can comfortably show a lot of text on screen at once \u2014 I find it easy to read and swipe through notifications without accidental misclicks or swipes.\n\nIt easily syncs with Apple apps like  Health  and  Fitness  to show data about your workouts, health and sleep. It can also take calls, send texts, make requests via Siri voice assistant and more.\n\nCompared to the previous model, the Series 10 has a slightly thinner case and the bezels around the screen have also been slimmed down. The screen itself is brighter when you look at it off-angle, meaning it\u2019s been easier for me to check the time or a notification at a glance, without turning the watch to face me directly.\n\nIt still has all the features I loved from the  Apple Watch Series 9 , including the double-tap gesture, plus some new ones like sleep apnea notifications and depth and water temperature sensors for swimming.\n\nThe Series 10 gets up to 18 hours of battery life \u2014 less than many of its competitors. It comes in two sizes, 42mm and 46mm, in aluminum or titanium versions.  You can learn more in my  Apple Watch Series 10 review .\n\nEditor\u2019s Note : I\u2019m currently testing the latest  Google Pixel Watch 4 , which launches October 9th. We may update this story after my testing period.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 3 is the best Pixel watch yet (and an  NBC Select Wellness Awards  winner), with major design and fitness improvements over the previous model that make it a solid option, especially for someone with a Google Pixel phone.\n\nThe watch has built-in Fitbit fitness tracking, although it is more in-depth compared to something like the  Fitbit Charge 6 . Like the previous models, it automatically detects walking, running, biking, treadmill, elliptical, rower and spin exercises after five minutes (15 for walking), and asks if you\u2019d like to start the workout. As someone who often forgets to log walks, I love this feature.\n\nNew to the Pixel Watch 3 are running features like custom runs you can build yourself, with warm-up, cool-downs, intervals and heart rate targets. As you run, the watch will buzz and cue your next section or indicate if you are on, ahead or behind your target goals. I use custom runs all the time on Apple Watch and Garmin devices, which is a great feature to now have on the Google Pixel Watch.\n\nIt comes in two sizes, 41 millimeters and 45 millimeters, with screens that are up to twice as bright as the previous version. Battery life is also improved \u2014 it lasts up to 24 hours, according to the brand.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch has been a favorite for years, largely because of its sleek, attractive design \u2014 it\u2019s one of the only smartwatches that gets me compliments around the office.\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 continues this winning streak with a new design \u2014 the watch is still round, but the sides are straight, leading to a circle-meets-square shape. In practical terms, the watch sits more comfortably on my wrist and is easier to use than previous models.\n\nLike years prior, it has two customizable buttons that can help you more easily control the watch. Touch controls are not ideal for outdoor fitness, especially in bad weather, so I always appreciate physical buttons I can use to open specific apps or navigate menus.\n\nOne of the biggest new software features this year is Google Gemini \u2014 you can ask the AI almost anything, but it\u2019s still hit or miss with its answers, in my experience. More concrete improvements include  Samsung Running Coach , which can create a personalized running plan based on your fitness and goals.\n\nIt is compatible with all Android phones, but some of its features only work if you pair it with a Samsung phone, such as ECG readings, irregular heart rhythm notifications and sleep apnea detection.\n\nGarmin makes some of the best fitness trackers, and the Vivoactive 6 hits the right balance between features, style and price, making it our favorite smartwatch from the brand.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most comfortable smartwatches I\u2019ve tested \u2014 it\u2019s noticeably lightweight and has a soft and flexible silicone band that never irritated my skin. It has two buttons along the side, one opens the workout menu, where there are over 80 activity profiles to choose from, including custom workouts. Through the Garmin Connect app, you can view all your health, sleep, stress and workout stats. But Garmin also has more in-depth fitness measurements like  Training Readiness ,  Body Battery  and  Sleep Coach , all of which helped me better understand when it was time for a push day or a rest day.\n\nIts biggest strength is battery life \u2014 the Vivoactive 6 gets up to 5 days of battery life with the always-on display and 11 days without it. That is far longer than all of our other picks, and more than most smartwatches on the market.\n\nOne useful new addition to the Vivoactive 6 is workout animations \u2014 if you use one of Garmin\u2019s built-in strength or flexibility workouts, it will play animations of each movement as you start an exercise set.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note : I\u2019m currently testing the latest  Apple Watch SE 3 , which launched September 19th. We may update this story after my testing period.\n\nThe Apple Watch SE costs much less than the Apple Watch Series 10  and  Apple Watch Ultra 2 , but has much of the same design and features that make those watches great.\n\nIt syncs seamlessly with your iPhone and iPhone apps \u2014 it feels like a natural extension of your phone, straight out of the box. Like the Series 10, it connects with Apple  Health  and  Fitness  apps to show detailed workout, sleep and health data, with more info than many competitors at this price point, no subscription required.\n\nCompared to the Series 10, the SE is a little slower, smaller and has a dimmer screen that cannot be changed to an always-on mode. It also does not have an on-screen keyboard \u2014 you can send pre-set responses or dictate using voice-to-text with Siri. It comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with many  watch band  options.\n\nSmartwatches have so many features that they can be overwhelming out of the box. Most people I know complete the initial setup and never customize anything aside from the background on the watch face. Below are a few of the most useful features across every smartwatch you may want to try out:\n\nAlmost every smartwatch lets you customize the default watch face. Scroll through the watch or watch companion app settings and tinker with customizing the watch face. All of our top picks let you change the layout, colors, background and stats, with many more options if you dig a little deeper. One NBC Select staffer has her Apple Watch face set to a picture of her cat, for example.\n\nMost smartwatches have robust safety features available. This means you have the option to manually or automatically send your live location to a list of emergency contacts, depending on how you set it up. If you are planning an activity where you would feel safer having the option to automatically reach out to emergency contacts (or emergency services), be sure to set up this feature.\n\nSmartwatches generally support one form of contactless payment, think Apple Pay, Samsung Wallet, Google Wallet or Garmin Pay. These apps can store your debit or credit information and let you tap-to-pay at supported businesses like cafes, restaurants and even most public transport. This is a useful feature to set up if you hate carrying your wallet everywhere you go.\n\nYou can get much longer battery life if you change a few of the settings on your smartwatch. Turning off the always-on display, lowering your screen brightness and adjusting background app refresh settings can all help extend the time you get between charges.\n\nI am a  reporter  at NBC Select who covers technology and fitness, including recent stories on  fitness trackers ,  running shoes ,  point-and-shoot cameras  and more. For this piece, I tried over a dozen top-rated fitness trackers and smartwatches. For a broader perspective, I spoke with other NBC Select staffers about their experience with smartwatches.\n\nCatch up on NBC Select\u2019s in-depth coverage of  tech and tools ,  wellness  and more, and follow us on  Facebook ,  Instagram ,  Twitter  and  TikTok  to stay up to date.\n\nHarry Rabinowitz is a reporter for NBC Select, where he is constantly trying and reviewing the latest and greatest tech gadgets.\n\n\u00a9\u00a02025 SELECT | All rights reserved.

How we picked the best smartwatches Most NBC Select staffers use a smartwatch \u2014 either for notifications, exercise or sleep tracking. Combining their experience with my time testing, we selected smartwatches keeping the following in mind: Ease of use: Smartphones have so many features and options that they can easily become overwhelming. We selected products that are easy and enjoyable to use out of the box, both glancing at your wrist and scrolling in the app. We also favored watches that let you customize settings, watch faces and notifications to your liking.Compatibility: Not all smartwatches are compatible with all smartphones \u2014 it\u2019s quite the opposite. We included wearables for people with all kinds of smartphones. How I test smartwatches I\u2019ve tested over a dozen smartwatches for NBC Select. I am a runner and cyclist, and often use them to track and monitor stats like heart rate, pace and time. I am also the tech reporter at NBC Select, so I tend to spend hours tinkering with product settings, exploring what a product offers out of the box and what I can fine-tune later.
