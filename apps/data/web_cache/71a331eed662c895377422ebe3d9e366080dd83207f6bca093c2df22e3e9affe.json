Best pair of run tights\n\nOverall I liked these. First time going in a small and was surprised how loose the waist was, compared to the legs, but that could just be me. Felt great running.\n\nLight compressive feel and did not slouch on my runs. Perfect to go with any top!\n\nSo excited about this new line from Zoot. I bought the tights and 3\" run shorts. The tights are awesome, my only issue is, they might run a little bigger than some other tights/leggings I've purchased. I always wear a medium and the medium feels bigger than I'd like. I'd like a bit more compression.\n\nI love the sleekness of the run tight. I am 5\u20195 so they are a little longer on me. The run tights are super comfortable though and move well from physical activity to running errands.\n\nAmazing feel and love the fabric ! Best pair of run tights\n\nOverall I liked these.
