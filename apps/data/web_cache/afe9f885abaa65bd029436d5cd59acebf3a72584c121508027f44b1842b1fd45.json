Here\u2019s how it works .\n\nI've been using and loving Windows PCs since the '90s, so I can tell you with confidence that the best Windows laptops are better than they've ever been\u2014as long as you've made peace with Windows 11.\n\nI have my own problems with Microsoft's latest, but after getting to grips with Windows 11 I've gotten over my gripes. If you're looking to buy a laptop that runs it well I recommend the  Dell XPS 13  as the best Windows laptop for most due to its elegent design and light weight, as well as the fact that its Snapdragon chips deliver MacBook-beating speed and battery life.\n\nFor those looking to save money I heartily recommend the  Acer Aspire Go 15  as a budget alternative because it gives you a full Windows 11 laptop for under $500. But if you need a gaming laptop I suggest the  Asus ROG Zephyrus G14  because it runs most games great and doubles as a productivity laptop in a pinch.\n\nRead on for more recommendations (backed up by our own in-house lab testing) about which are the best Windows laptops you can buy, as well as full reviews of each machine to help you find the right laptop for you!\n\nIn a hurry?

It's not fast or powerful, but it's fine for writing papers or web surfing.\n\nRead more below\n\nBest 2-in-1\n\nThe Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED is one of the  best 2-in-1 laptops  if you love Windows 11 because it looks and feels great, offers lots of ports, enough power for work or play and a lovely 2.8K OLED panel. The webcam isn't amazing, but it's good enough!\n\nRead more below\n\nBest dual-screen 2-in-1\n\nIt took me time to get to grips with, but the Yoga Book 9i is a compelling alternative to foldable screen laptops because you get two 13-inch displays in one package. There are some clever software gestures and multitasking features here, too.\n\nRead more below\n\nBest for gaming\n\nWhile not the fastest or biggest gaming laptop around, I love the Asus Zephyrus G14 because it can run most games at solid framerates, giving you enough power to get work done in a pinch in an elegant ultraportable design. Read more below\n\nBest for creators\n\nThe Asus ProArt P16 stands heads and shoulders above the rest as the best for creators \u2014 packing the latest AMD power alongside RTX 4070 graphics, a gorgeous 4K OLED touchscreen panel, and a thoughtful aesthetic with ergonomics that keep you in your creative flow.\n\nRead more below\n\nLoad the next 3 products...\n\nBest OLED\n\nAn XPS in all but name, the Dell 14 Premium can be outfitted with a gorgeous 14.5-inch 3.2K OLED touchscreen that makes everything you do on it look amazing. It's pretty powerful too, though it eats through battery and barely lasted 8 hours in our tests.\n\nRead more below\n\nBest for business\n\nThe Lenovo Slim 7 is the Windows laptop I recommend most for business use because it's easy to carry and gives you a lovely 14-inch OLED touchscreen, 10+ hours of tested battery life and a laptop that's comfy to type on for a great price.\n\nRead more below\n\nBest Samsung\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro is a svelte laptop featuring a gorgeous 16-inch OLED display, fast Intel Lunar Lake performance and a spacious keyboard. Though its AI capabilities aren\u2019t anything special and it has too many superfluous Samsung apps, the Galaxy Book 5 Pro is still an overall excellent laptop for work and play.\n\nRead more below\n\nWhy you can trust Tom's Guide\n \n \n \n \n Our writers and editors spend hours analyzing and reviewing products, services, and apps to help find what's best for you.  Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nI have an easy time recommending the Dell XPS 13 as the best Windows laptop for most folks because it sports the same sleek, attractive design that the XPS line has had for years. But unlike prior models, the latest Dell XPS 13 can be had with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chips inside, and these models deliver excellent performance and insanely long battery life (nearly 20 hours in our testing).\n\nEven if you get a model with Intel chips you can look forward to a premium Windows laptop experience thanks to the XPS 13's thin, nearly bezel-less 1200p display and eye-catching design. I had a hard time getting used to using the capacitive touch keys and the invisible touchpad, but once you get the hang of it there's nothing to it.\n\nWhile you don't get a ton of ports, this svelte 13-incher is lean and mean and comes with USB-C ports you can use to connect external peripherals. It's basically a MacBook Air competitor, and if you can afford the cost I think it's one of the best Windows laptops you can get for getting work done on the go.\n\nFor all these reasons and more, this is the Windows laptop we recommend most often to those in the market for a new notebook for work, school or play.\n\nRead our full  Dell XPS 13 (2024) .\n\nOur expert review:\n\nOne thing I like about Windows laptops is that you can get a really useful PC for not too much money. This helps Windows laptops stand out from MacBooks, and gives you more leeway to get a great value.\n\nCase in point: Acer's Aspire Go 15 isn't an amazing laptop, but it doesn't have to be when the asking price is $300. At that price, you can make peace with the fact that the Go 15's low-powered CPU and paltry complement of 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage aren't good for much else besides browsing the web, writing and editing, and maybe some very light gaming.\n\nBut that's fine for folks who just need a cheap laptop to browse the web or write emails. What the Acer Aspire Go 15 lacks in features or charm it more than makes up for in utility, as it offers 10 hours of (tested) battery life and a keyboard that's surprisingly comfy to type on.\n\nAnd while I think its 15.6-inch 1080p screen looks a bit washed-out and won't make colors pop, it's more than good enough for web surfing or working with documents.\n\nThe Acer Aspire Go 15 doesn't look, feel or sound as fancy as the other laptops on this list, but it's a serviceable workhorse with a $299 price tag, making it the best Windows laptop for those on a budget and looking for great value.\n\nRead our full  Acer Aspire Go 15 review.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nOne of the things that's great about Windows laptops is that you can get a lot of 2-in-1 designs that allow you to flip the touchscreen over, turning the laptop into something resembling a giant Windows 11 tablet.\n\nThis gives you a lot of versatility, and one of my favorites is the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED. Sure, the 720p webcam is disappointing and the laptop managed under ten hours in our battery test, putting it behind  best MacBooks  in terms of power efficiency. But if you can live with those drawbacks, you get a lot of great stuff in this Windows 11 2-in-1.\n\nFor instance, I think the beautiful 2.8K OLED screen makes whatever you do on it look nice, and the keyboard is comfy and nice to use. I found performance is plenty fast, and when you factor in the svelte and beautiful chassis sporting plenty of ports you start to see why this affordable 2-in-1 is a compelling value.\n\nThat's why I think if you\u2019re in the market for a dependable 2-in-1 with a svelte design and eye-pleasing OLED panel, this is a great laptop to get!\n\nRead our full  Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED review .\n\nOur expert review:\n\nI know, this laptop looks wild in photos. But once you get the hang of using it, I think there's a lot to recommend it.\n\nSee, the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i unites a pair of beautiful 13.3-inch OLED displays in one device, delivering you a unique laptop that can turn into a variety of unique-looking configurations to fit your needs. This laptop can stand in as a traditional Windows 11 laptop or tablet, plus it can go into tent mode for presentations.\n\nWhile the design itself can feel a little flimsy and less than sturdy, when you get the hang of using it you may appreciate how versatile and useful this two-screen machine be. Type right on one display or use the separate Bluetooth keyboard to bang out emails on your lap in one screen while you watch movies on the other, and you'll start to appreciate how this laptop starts to feel like a Swiss Army knife.\n\nThough it\u2019s expensive for what you get, this oddball laptop offers enough singular value to be included in this list. If you're the kind of person who absolutely can't work without two screens, this is a great option for getting things done on the go.\n\nRead our full  Lenovo Yoga 9i review.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 has been one of my favorite gaming laptops for a long time, and I think the latest model is better than ever thanks to its 3K OLED display.\n\nI like the G14 because it doesn't look so much like a typical gaming laptop, encased as it is in a slick 14-inch ultraportable chassis that has plenty of ports and looks good on a desk.\n\nSadly, the laptop lasted under 7 hours surfing the web in our battery test and just over an hour while gaming, so it's not got great battery life. But that's to be expected with gaming laptops, and as long as you keep it plugged in while gaming this machine is a lovely little workhorse.\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 laptop GPU in our review unit gives it more than enough muscle to play the latest games well, especially if you rely on Nvidia's DLSS upscaling tech, making this the best gaming laptop we recommend most.\n\nRead our full  Asus ROG Zephryus G14 review .\n\nOur expert review:\n\nWhen our own Jason England tried out the Asus ProArt P16 for review he was blown away by the sleek, attractive design and eye-catching 4K OLED display. If you want a Windows laptop as attractive and powerful as a MacBook Pro, this is the creator laptop I recommend most often.\n\nThe reason? This mean-looking matte black aluminum beast has power to spare and evinces some thoughtful attention to the ergonomics \u2014 including a stellar keyboard and touchpad, alongside a DialPad for finite creative control over your projects.\n\nBut it all comes together with the display and internals you need for even the most power-hungry workflows. The 4K OLED touchscreen is color calibrated for peak accuracy and confidence in the hues of your work, and that AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 + RTX 4070 combo tears through any intense processing in record time.\n\nAdmittedly, battery life suffers because of it, but if you\u2019re looking for the best laptop to create great content, this is the I recommend you buy.\n\nRead our full  Asus ProArt P16 review .\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe Dell 14 Premium is what we used to call the Dell XPS 14, but now it has a fancy new name gracing the familiar function row-less Dell laptop design.\n\nPerhaps the most premium feature of the Dell 14 is its 14.5-inch (3,200 x 2,000 pixels) 120Hz OLED touchscreen. In our hands-on testing this display makes everything you do on it look better, from streaming UHD shows to gaming in HDR and even just slinging spreadsheets. An OLED display is one of the upgrades I prize most in a PC because it helps you see brilliant whites, inky blacks and deep contrasts in movies and games.\n\nThis portable powerhouse is pretty good for mid-range gaming too thanks to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 laptop GPU you can equip it with. But if you don't need to play much more than the occasional game of Solitaire or Candy Crush, you can get away with the cheaper model packing just an Intel Arc integrated graphics card.\n\nNo matter which GPU you go with, you should get plenty of computing power thanks to the Intel Core Ultra 7 255H CPU driving the Dell 14 Premium. In our CPU testing it competed favorably with the MacBook Pro M4 and even beat it out in multi-threaded CPU performance, and that pairs with the 32GB of onboard RAM to give you lots of multi-tasking power.\n\nThe 1 TB of SSD storage gives you plenty of room to store your work as fell as a few cherished movies and games, but be careful when you take this thing out and about. In our battery tests it barely lasted eight hours surfing the web on a full charge, so you may want to consider bringing the charger with you for a day of work or school.\n\nBut wherever you take it, rest assured whatever you're up to will look luscious on the lovely 14.5-inch OLED display.\n\nRead our full Dell 14 Premium review.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nI'm fond of the Lenovo Slim 7, and I often recommend it as the best Windows business laptop because its easy to carry, comfy to type on and offers good performance and battery life (10+ hours tested).\n\nThis is a great laptop for folks who need something that can do double duty as a personal and work laptop. While it's not powerful enough to play serious games or do demanding editing work, it's more than speedy enough for writing, doing homework, putting together presentations and tackling remote coursework.\n\nThe upside is that while you don't get a ton of power, you get some nice creature comforts that make using this laptop a delight. I really love the 14-inch OLED touchscreen, which makes everything you do on the device look lovely. Plus, the touchscreen functionality gives you the option of taking your hands off the keyboard and trackpad to tap and swipe when you feel like it.\n\nThe keyboard also feels better than most beneath my fingers, thanks to the generous spacing between keys and the subtle indents on each that help your fingers rest comfortably.\n\nThe downside is that the power cable is awfully short, which means you may have a tricky time plugging into an outlet in crowded meeting rooms or coffee shops. The fact that the power button is on the side of the laptop is also frustrating, since it caused me to occasionally power the thing off or put it into sleep mode when I was just trying to plug something in.\n\nBut overall, this is a great ultraportable that's the best Windows laptop for business use I've ever reviewed. The model I reviewed is sold at Costco so it's a great deal, but if you can't find it at Costco or don't have a membership Lenovo sells very similar models at Amazon and Best Buy.\n\nRead our full  Lenovo Slim 7 review .\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro has everything we love about the company's laptops. This includes a slim design, beautiful OLED display and a fantastic keyboard. This models packs the latest Intel Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" chip, which gives it enough power for everyday work and even light gaming. And if you're into AI, this laptop comes with Copilot+ built-in.\n\nThe star of the show is the 16-inch (2880 x 1800) OLED display. It delivers vibrant image quality, making movies and shows look stunning. It also gets decently bright with both SDR and HDR content, further ensuring you can see even the smallest details in videos and websites.\n\nThe lightweight and thin design makes this an excellent travel partner. Not only is it easy to carry around, it\u2019s also stylish thanks to its dark gray color and all-around minimalist aesthetic. It also has a decent amount of ports, including a USB-A port for legacy devices.\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 chip is powerful enough for watching videos, browsing the web and getting work done. That said, competitors with Snapdragon X Elite inside have better performance and battery life. The Galaxy Book 5 Pro\u2019s AI capabilities work well for translating videos or generating images in Microsoft Paint, but this likely won't be a selling point for most folks.\n\nThough Copilot+ PCs with Snapdragon X Elite have better performance and energy efficiency, Lunar Lake laptops like the Galaxy Book 5 Pro have greater compatibility with apps and programs than Qualcomm\u2019s notebook chips. Add the beautiful OLED display and portability, and the Galaxy Book 5 Pro is arguably the best Samsung Windows laptop right now.\n\nFind our full  Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro review .\n\nWe test and review over a hundred Windows laptops every year, and they can't all be the best\u2014 but just because they don't all make this list doesn't mean they aren't good machines.\n\nNo, there are loads of great laptops that don't quite achieve the level of excellence needed to lead the pack. But they're still great machines, and they're worth considering if you're looking for a specific feature or another laptop you want isn't available.\n\nBelow, I've gathered all the great laptops we've tested which don't quite make this list, but are still good alternatives well worth considering if they meet your unique needs, or if you can't find your first choice on sale.\n\nDell 14 Plus (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606) The Dell 14 Plus is the epitome of a boring business laptop thanks to its discreet, dull design and dim display, but while it's not great enough to climb our list it delivers good performance and battery life (plus a comfy keyboard) for not too much money. I prefer the Lenovo Slim 7 for a 14-inch business laptop, but this one is a solid buy.\n\nRead our full  Dell 14 Plus review .\n\nLenovo Legion Pro 7i (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606) I'm a big fan of the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i because it's a capable gaming laptop that sports a sleek design, plenty of ports and a gorgeous 16-inch 1600p 240Hz OLED display. And now that it comes with RTX 50-series laptop GPUs, it can basically plug into your TV and function as a gaming PC you can take with you on the go.\n\nHowever, I don't recommend it over the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 because the G14 is smaller and lighter, making it a lot easier to manipulate. And since the G14 also comes with RTX 50-series GPUs now, the Legion Pro 7i's amazing power is not unique to it.\n\nRead our full  Lenovo Legion Pro 7i review .\n\nMSI Prestige 16 AI Evo (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606) This is a big, speedy Windows 11 laptop with a good (if glossy) 16-inch screen, good performance and 15+ hours of tested battery life thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 2 CPUs. It's not great for gaming and not quite great enough to make the short list, but it is nice for getting work done on the go thanks to its surprising portability.\n\nRead our full  MSI Prestige 16 AI Evo review .\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7 (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606) The Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 is the first Surface Laptop to ship with a Snapdragon CPU inside, and the extra power and battery life it affords make this the best Surface Laptop yet. I don't love how middle-of-the-road it is and you can do better in a Windows laptop, but good battery life and performance (plus a comfy keyboard and Wi-Fi 7 support) make this a reliable ultraportable for getting work done.\n\nRead our full  Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 review .\n\nCPU speed isn't everything, but putting a number on it can go a long way towards helping you understand exactly how fast a laptop is in relation to the rest of the options available to you.\n\nWe test every laptop we review in a number of areas, including CPU performance, so I've taken the liberty of putting together a quick chart here of all the performance scores from the laptops on this list so you can compare them at a glance.\n\nWe use Geekbench for these tests, as it assigns each laptop a score for its performance in single-core workloads and multi-core workloads. The single-core score is often a little more meaningful because not all apps are optimized for multi-core performance, but many are so its good to consider multi-core performance as well.\n\nLaptop\n\nSingle-core\n\nMulti-core\n\nDell XPS 13\n\n2797\n\n14635\n\nDell 14 Premium\n\n2,701\n\n15,794\n\nAcer Aspire Go 15\n\n1310\n\n5209\n\nAsus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED\n\n2524\n\n10540\n\nFramework Laptop\n\n", "excerpt": "I review a ton of laptops, and I think these are the best Windows machines\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.
