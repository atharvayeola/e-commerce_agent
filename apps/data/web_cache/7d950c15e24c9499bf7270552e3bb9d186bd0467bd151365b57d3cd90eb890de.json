She used 72 bags of popcorn to find the best microwave (and set the office on fire only once).\n\nIt's the final Prime Day of the year! See all of the  (actually good) deals  our experts have spotted so far.\n\nPlus: Sign up for  Wirecutter\u2019s daily newsletter  to get handpicked deals straight to your inbox.\n\nWe\u2019ve noticed stock issues with our top-pick microwave, the  Panasonic Genius Sensor Inverter NN-SN686S . For an alternative, we  recommend other versions of this model .\n\nIf you use your countertop microwave only to zap cold coffee or nuke bags of buttered popcorn,  any model  will do. But nearly any other food prep \u2014 defrosting the latest  frozen flavors from Trader Joe\u2019s , reheating leftovers, making  crispy bacon  \u2014 benefits from a better machine.\n\nMost microwaves are made by the same two or three factories and tend to look, feel, and function similarly, and are sold at comparable prices. But the  Panasonic Genius Sensor Inverter NN-SN686S  is an exception, as it can zap, nuke, defrost, reheat, and steam more evenly and efficiently than competitors. It also comes with more thoughtful features and functionality, and it looks and feels a little nicer than the rest.\n\nThis midsize microwave offers the most even heating and the most useful, accurate sensors of any model we tested, and it opens with a button. But it lacks instant-start express settings.\n\nThis midsize microwave has instant-start express settings, a wide range of functions, and a door handle instead of a button.

It comes in three finishes, but it\u2019s narrow.\n\nMicrowaves with convection-oven, broiler, and air-fryer capabilities are far from perfect, but this handsome, well-made option is an excellent microwave and easier than others to clean.\n\nA button tends to look nicer and is easier to use, but some people prefer a handle. We have picks with both.\n\nSome models automatically start cooking at the highest power when you press a number \u2014 preferable for shared kitchens but not great for most food.\n\nMidsize is ideal for most kitchens. Extra-large or extra-powerful microwaves are typically unnecessary, while compact models are too small.\n\nYou can pay more for a microwave with convection-bake, broil, and air-fryer functions, but it isn\u2019t a total replacement for all those countertop appliances.\n\nThis midsize microwave offers the most even heating and the most useful, accurate sensors of any model we tested, and it opens with a button. But it lacks instant-start express settings.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: We\u2019ve noticed stock issues with the Panasonic Genius Sensor Inverter NN-SN686S. For an alternative, we  recommend other versions of this model .\n\nThe well-priced, midsize  Panasonic Genius Sensor Inverter NN-SN686S \u00a0cooked more evenly and precisely than any other microwave we tested, with fewer hot and cold spots.\n\nWith a 1.2-cubic-foot capacity and 1,200 watts of power, this model is large and powerful enough for a family but doesn\u2019t take up too much room. The extra-large button that opens the door latch was the easiest to use among the microwaves we tried. Though this model lacks instant-start express settings, the sensor-reheat option is especially useful, as it automatically shuts off when it senses the proper amount of steam.\n\nGenius Sensor Inverter models are also available in  other finishes and sizes , and most allow for an optional matching trim kit for a built-in look. The NN-SN686S is available only online from  Amazon ,  Walmart , and  Panasonic.com , but similar models are available at Costco ( NN-SN68QB )  ( membership required )   and Target ( NN-SC67NS ) stores. It comes with a one-year warranty, as well as a five-year warranty for the magnetron (parts only).\n\nSpecs: Dimensions:  12.25 by 20.69 by 15.81 inches (HWD) Power:  1,200 watts Capacity:  1.2 cubic feet Warranty:  one year, five years for the magnetron (parts only)\n\nThis midsize microwave has instant-start express settings, a wide range of functions, and a door handle instead of a button. But it doesn\u2019t heat as quickly or evenly as our pick.\n\nYou save $25 (17%)\n\nThe midsize, 1.2-cubic-foot, 1,100-watt  Toshiba EM131A5C  has a nicer design and a broader range of functions \u2014 including convenient instant-start settings \u2014 than most other microwaves at its price.\n\nIt performed solidly in our tests, but it didn\u2019t heat as quickly, precisely, or evenly as our top pick, and it\u2019s slightly less powerful. This model has a sturdy door handle, which some people prefer over a push button.\n\nThe EM131A5C is available in two finishes, as well as  other sizes . It has a one-year warranty.\n\nSpecs: Dimensions:  12.8 by 20.5 by 17.1 inches (HWD) Power:  1,100 watts Capacity:  1.2 cubic feet Warranty:  one year\n\nThe most compact microwave we tested, this model is sturdy and easy to use, and it offers more functionality than most at this size. It comes in three finishes, but it\u2019s narrow.\n\nThe 700-watt  GE GCST07N1  is a bit shorter, shallower, and narrower than any other compact microwave we tested. It\u2019s sturdier, too, though the cavity (0.7 cubic foot) is wide enough for only a medium-size dinner plate.\n\nThis microwave didn\u2019t cook as evenly or precisely as our top pick, but it was faster than similarly sized models with higher wattage, and it has convenient instant-start express settings.\n\nIt is available in three finishes (the most of our picks) and  a version  that you can mount under a cabinet. It comes with a one-year warranty.\n\nSpecs: Dimensions:  10.2 by 17.3 by 12.75 inches (HWD) Power:  700 watts Capacity:  0.7 cubic foot Warranty:  one year\n\nMicrowaves with convection-oven, broiler, and air-fryer capabilities are far from perfect, but this handsome, well-made option is an excellent microwave and easier than others to clean.\n\nThe  Panasonic HomeChef Connect 4-in-1 Multi-oven NN-CV87QS  combines microwaving, fan-assisted convection baking, broiling, and air frying in one sleek, 1.2-cubic-foot stainless steel machine. It\u2019s a nice option for a tiny kitchen or as a temporary replacement for an oven.\n\nWith 1,000 watts of power, it microwaved as well as our top pick in our tests. Like other combination microwaves, though, it can\u2019t brown or crisp foods as effectively or quickly as a traditional oven or  air fryer toaster oven . But its hidden baking element (in contrast to most other combination microwaves, which have an exposed element) seems to improve cooking results, and it\u2019s much easier to clean.\n\nThe HomeChef Connect 4-in-1 Multi-oven comes with a helpful manual and access to a recipe app, both of which can help you navigate the admittedly complicated machine. (The app can also connect to the microwave via Wi-Fi, so that you could monitor timers or change a handful of settings remotely.) It has a three-year warranty, and the magnetron is covered for one year (parts only).\n\nSpecs: Dimensions:  13.5 by 22.1 by 17.7 inches (HWD) Power:  1,000 watts Capacity:  1.2 cubic feet Warranty:  three years, one year for the magnetron (parts only)\n\nI\u2019m a senior staff writer covering large kitchen appliances at Wirecutter, as well as a journalist with nearly 20 years of experience writing about food, cooking, and the culinary industry. I\u2019ve written guides to  gas  and  electric ranges ,  induction cooktops ,  coffee grinders , and  French-door refrigerators . I also offer advice on how to make the most of large kitchen appliances, including tips on  cleaning your microwave  and  improving its performance .\n\nWirecutter has been evaluating microwaves since 2014. For this guide, we\u2019ve done the following:\n\nLike all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I\u2019m never made aware of any  business implications  of my editorial recommendations, and in accordance with  Wirecutter standards , I return or donate all products I\u2019ve tested once my assessment of them is complete. Read more about our  editorial standards .\n\nThis guide focuses on countertop microwaves (including  compact  and multifunction  convection/air-fryer models ) that you can set up almost anywhere you have an outlet. We highlight a handful of higher-quality microwaves that work a bit better or look and feel a little better than the vast majority you can find online or in stores. But if you use a microwave only for a few small tasks that don\u2019t require a lot of precision \u2014 popping popcorn, heating liquids \u2014 and don\u2019t care what it looks like, you might be fine with a  budget model .\n\nSome of our recommendations have matching trim kits that allow you to install them in a cutout in the wall or a cabinet so that the machine resembles a more expensive  built-in wall or drawer microwave  for a fraction of the cost. We also have a separate guide to  over-the-range microwaves , which generally serve as a  range hood  as well.\n\nFor previous versions of this guide, we analyzed microwave designs and components (including taking multiple microwaves apart, which revealed many manufacturer logos), investigated public import records, and interviewed brand representatives.\n\nOur discovery: The majority of countertop microwaves sold in the US, no matter the logo, are manufactured by just a few companies overseas, primarily Midea and Galanz. That is why you can find dozens of mostly sub-$100 microwaves with different brand names but nearly identical prices, specs, and designs.\n\nThese lower-cost microwaves tend to be nearly identical inside and out, and they tend to perform similarly. They come under many brand names, including Black+Decker and Comfee (both of which we now know are made by Midea) or RCA and Avanti (which are made by Galanz). Hamilton Beach, Insignia (Best Buy\u2019s house brand), Kenmore, Magic Chef, and Panasonic (some of its less expensive models without  inverter  motors) also have microwaves made by either Midea or Galanz. The upshot: If you want a basic, under-$100 microwave, it doesn\u2019t make much difference which make or model you choose.\n\nThis is why we now focus on a few brands that we know either manufacture their own microwaves (such as LG, Panasonic, and Samsung) or work with these large manufacturers to produce microwaves with improved design or functionality. This group includes most well-known kitchen-appliance brands, such as GE Appliances and Whirlpool, as well as companies like Breville, IKEA (whose appliances are made to its specifications by other manufacturers), and Sharp (which has historically worked with Midea).\n\nAfter years of testing, we\u2019ve learned that these better-quality models, even compact ones, usually cost at least $100. In 2024, Catherine Ruspino\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, a senior vice president at Breville responsible for microwaves, spoke to us at length about the constraints of working with large manufacturers and what kinds of innovations were possible. Better-quality models have at least slightly better computer programs and algorithms for functions such as defrosting or auto-cooking. They often have slightly different designs for the contours of the interior, intended to better distribute the  electromagnetic waves  and result in more even cooking. They also have better-quality exterior components and materials, which is important; the door latch, for instance, serves as a  kill switch  for the entire microwave. And on top of all that, we\u2019ve noticed that better microwaves tend to provide clearer advice in their manuals.\n\nSub-$100 microwaves  can still heat or defrost your food just fine, albeit a little less evenly or quickly. (And you can get even better results if you follow our tips for  improving the performance of any microwave .) But the cheapest models are likely to be smaller, flimsier, lighter (yours might move around the counter when you open and close it, which is frustrating), and more prone to breaking down. Some models lack the most basic features, such as an Add 30 Seconds button.\n\nAnd some ultra-cheap models don\u2019t list a certification from  UL Solutions , a firm that sets safety standards for most small appliances in the United States, in their manuals or inside the machine, which prevents us from confirming that they\u2019ve undergone  safety testing . No matter the price, we don\u2019t recommend buying any microwave that is not UL Solutions\u2013certified.\n\nIn our most recent round of testing, in 2024, we evaluated nearly two dozen microwaves in our testing facility in Long Island City, New York.\n\nTo determine the cooking performance and usability of each microwave, we opened and shut doors, pressed buttons, and warmed, defrosted, cooked, and reheated dozens of foods, including burritos, butter, chicken breasts, coffee, fried rice, frozen broccoli, mac and cheese, pizza, and popcorn. When testing convection/air-fryer models, we also air-fried, baked, and toasted.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the factors we evaluate:\n\nSize:  Microwaves typically fall into three size categories, namely small/compact (0.7 to 0.9 cubic foot of capacity), midsize (1 to 1.6 cubic feet of capacity), and large (up to 2.2 cubic feet of capacity). In our testing, we\u2019ve found that a midsize model with 1.1 or 1.2 cubic feet of capacity and a 12-inch carousel is ideal for most households. This size can fit a 12-inch dinner plate, a 9-inch square casserole dish with handles, a large bag of microwave popcorn, two frozen dinners, four mugs, or two smaller bowls.\n\nAnything smaller than midsize is best for one person or light usage. (The smallest model we tested can\u2019t even accommodate a New York\u2013style slice of pizza.) And most small microwaves are so light, they move on the counter when you open or shut the door, though our pick for a  compact microwave  is an exception. Anything larger than midsize (1.4 cubic feet and up) costs more and takes up more counter space without offering additional benefit, unless you regularly microwave a lot of food at a time.\n\nAll microwaves vary slightly in height, width, and depth, so be sure to double-check the dimensions of the microwave and measure your favorite microwave-safe cookware and your counter or shelf space to confirm that everything will fit. For some powerful models, manufacturers also recommend allowing for extra clearance at the rear and top of the machine.\n\nBuild and design:  A microwave should feel sturdy. The body should be well built, and the control panel shouldn\u2019t be so flimsy that it bends when you press a button. The machine should be hefty enough to stay put when you open and close the door. The display should be well-lit and easy to read, and any buttons, knobs, or handles should not be especially difficult to turn, pull, or press, particularly for anyone with mobility issues.\n\nSince a microwave lives on your counter, we also sought out models that look good, if not great, with appealing shapes and bodies made of more metal than plastic (or, at least, better-quality plastic).\n\nDoor latches:  We generally prefer microwaves with a button to open the door latch, as such designs are less likely to drag the machine when you open or shut the door and are also considered  ADA-compliant . But we do recommend a few options with handles, which some people prefer; feedback from our  paid testers  has shown that for people with hand-mobility issues, a handle can be easier to maneuver than a button.\n\nNoise:  People want a quiet microwave, but our testing has shown that they all make noise when running \u2014 and larger, more powerful, better-quality microwaves tend to be louder than smaller ones. If your microwave is especially loud or annoying, consider moving it so that the sound isn\u2019t reflecting off a wall or cabinet.\n\nEase of cleaning:  Most of the microwaves we test are equally  easy to clean , though white interiors show splatter more than darker colors. The exposed radiant bake elements on  some convection/air-fryer microwaves  are very hard to clean, and we don\u2019t recommend such models.\n\nReliability:  Any microwave can malfunction or stop working altogether. We focus on better-quality models with warranties of at least one year, from respected brands with websites and customer service teams accessible by phone. These microwaves tend to have better-quality mechanical parts, especially the door latch, which is a point of failure for many microwaves. Note that you should never use a microwave with a broken door latch.\n\nEven heating:  All microwaves heat foods somewhat unevenly, with cooler spots leading to undercooking and hotter spots resulting in burning or overcooking. In our latest testing, we evaluated evenness by cooking different foods \u2014 including marshmallows, which visibly show hot spots and degrees of doneness \u2014 across the breadth of the turntable. We also used an instant-read thermometer to check for temperature uniformity, a process that included heating up vegetarian burritos according to the package directions and then measuring the temperature in the middle and at both ends.\n\nHigher-performing microwaves, such as  our top pick , had fewer noticeable hot spots in our tests. Microwaves with an  inverter  motor, which can run at variable speeds and allows for continuous cooking at lower power levels, produced more even results when cooking and defrosting with less power. Inverter motors are usually found on midsize or large microwaves; our top pick has an inverter motor. (Traditional transformer-powered microwaves, which tend to be smaller in size, cycle between bursts of full power and zero power to achieve similar results.) To assess this, we microwaved raw, frozen chicken breasts at 50% power for 14 minutes before checking the temperature at three points. Inverter microwaves tended to yield partially defrosted meat that was more evenly warmed and had fewer large ice crystals and overcooked edges.\n\nSpeed and power:  All countertop microwaves have between 700 and 1,250 watts of power. Every midsize microwave we evaluated in the latest round offered at least 900 watts of power. Higher power heats things more quickly, but our testing revealed that even  a small, 700-watt microwave  can heat foods and liquids to appropriate temperatures, albeit slightly slower.\n\nMost good microwaves have at least 10 power levels. Foods defrost and cook more evenly at lower power levels, which also help you avoid splattering, drying out foods, and overcooking edges.\n\nUseful cooking functions:  Nearly every microwave expert we spoke to said that the vast majority of microwave owners use the Add 30 Seconds button exclusively when cooking, reheating, or defrosting. We heard the same thing from our paid testers and regular cooks, too. So we didn\u2019t pay much attention to specific presets for items such as a potato, popcorn, vegetables, or pizza. But we did give extra credit to microwaves whose additional functions or features produced better results without imposing a major learning curve: For instance, we appreciated an accurate sensor-reheat or sensor-cooking setting (like the one on  our top pick ), which measures humidity and knows when your food is done based on the amount of steam in the microwave.\n\nInstant-start express settings:  With these settings, the microwave starts automatically at its highest power when you press a numbered button or the Add 30 Seconds button \u2014 for example, pressing \u201c2\u201d starts the microwave for two minutes.\n\nThis midsize microwave offers the most even heating and the most useful, accurate sensors of any model we tested, and it opens with a button. But it lacks instant-start express settings.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: We\u2019ve noticed stock issues with the Panasonic Genius Sensor Inverter NN-SN686S.
