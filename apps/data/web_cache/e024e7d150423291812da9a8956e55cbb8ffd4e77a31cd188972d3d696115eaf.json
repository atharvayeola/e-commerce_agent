Whether you want a standard slab-style smartphone, a modern  folding phone , or a simple feature phone, there are many small but important factors to consider before you choose. PCMag has been covering cell phones for at least three decades and can help you sort through all the noise. Right now, four phones stand out among our Editors' Choice winners: the Apple iPhone 17 with its great mix of features and performance for the price, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with its artist-friendly S Pen stylus, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 with its expansive inner screen, and the Google Pixel 9a for its superb value. But all the phones here deserve your attention, so be sure to explore our full reviews linked below. Further down, we walk you through everything you need to know to pick the best one.\n\nOur experts have not selected this product for this story, it is a paid placement through our affiliate partnership team.\n\nSeptember 23, 2025: With this update, we added the Apple iPhone 17, replacing the iPhone 16 as the top iPhone for most people. We also swapped in the Google Pixel 10 Pro in place of the Google Pixel 9 as our recommended Android phone for most people. Our remaining picks have been vetted for currency and availability. Since our last update, we reviewed and evaluated 10 new phones for potential inclusion in this roundup and our other phone roundups. We currently have half a dozen phones in PC Labs for evaluation, from makers including Samsung and TCL.\n\nWith the iPhone 17, Apple has meaningfully upgraded the base model to level it up against the rest of the iPhone 17 family\u2014and competing flagships. With more than 24 hours of battery life, fast charging, modern radios, and high-quality hardware, it's a near-total package. Unless you're a power user who wants the photo and video tools of the Pro models, the iPhone 17 is the better value proposition.\n\nThis is by far the best iPhone for most people. It's got almost all of the features and performance of the Pro models for hundreds of dollars less.\n\nThe Google Pixel 9a is an excellent midrange value for Android fans thanks to its capable pair of cameras, bright screen, smooth performance, and refined design. It also provides a good range of AI-based photo-editing features, more than 13 hours of battery life, and an IP68 rating against dust and water ingress. We especially like that Google promises seven years of software updates, just like for the flagship  Pixel 9 lineup .\n\nIf you want premium features and performance for a reasonable price, the sub-$500 Pixel 9a is an obvious choice. The variety of color options is also a nice touch if you want to stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra includes high-end specs like the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, up to 1TB of storage with 12GB of RAM, and the best camera stack you can get on an Android phone in the US. The embedded S Pen stylus is another significant point in its favor, particularly if you're an artist or note-taker who likes to sketch or jot on the run. Let's not forget Galaxy AI, which is equal parts useful and fun, and Samsung's powerful productivity software, which lets you multitask on the large screen with ease.\n\nIf you want 5x telephoto zoom power, a 200MP main camera, good battery life, top performance, and a stylus, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the phone for you.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best large-screen foldable yet. It's lighter and more compact than the Z Fold 6, but still provides a larger cover screen and larger internal screen. We also like the  IP48 rating  and Samsung's commitment to seven years of software support. It has a stronger hinge, powerful multitasking features, advanced Galaxy AI tools, excellent 5G and Wi-Fi radios, and a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor\u2014all of which go a long way to justifying its admittedly high price.\n\nIf you are looking for an all-in-one solution for mobile productivity and entertainment, the Z Fold 7 is currently your best option. No other phone we've tested is as versatile and powerful.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 10 Pro packs the company\u2019s best hardware and software into a tough, midsize phone. You get premium construction, a bright, detailed screen, sharp cameras, and AI that runs locally to speed up everyday tasks. Features like live call translation and language-based photo edits create standout experiences you rarely find elsewhere.\n\nIf you enjoy mobile photography or want a pure Google software experience, the Pixel 10 Pro is the Android phone for you. If you don't upgrade your phone often, you will appreciate Google's promised seven years of OS updates.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A16 5G is an excellent value for under $200. Highlights include a large 90Hz screen, a good camera system, a new IP54 rating against dust and water, and a guarantee of six years' worth of security updates. It's not as tough as pricier phones, nor is it as fast, but given the low price, you can't ask for more.\n\nIf your budget is limited, the Galaxy A16 5G is an excellent choice thanks to its good everyday usability, above-average cameras, and long battery life. Midrange models outgun it, but it's easily the best Android phone under $200.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is packed with everything Apple has to offer. It has the biggest screen among iPhones, its battery lasts over 34 hours, the Camera Control button provides more creative flexibility, and upgraded radios mean faster wireless performance. It also has advanced video capture tools that are some of the best available on any phone.\n\nSimply put, this is the best iPhone if you want all the latest features, the longest battery life, and the best photo and video camera you can get.\n\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) embraces its dual-screen design in a way many alternatives don't; you can run virtually any app you want on either the vivid 4.0-inch outer display or the expansive 7.0-inch inner panel. We also like its IP48 waterproof rating, stylish design, competitive performance, and fast 68W wired charging.\n\nIf you want a small folding phone that encourages you to unlock it less often, the Razr Ultra is a top pick. Fashion-conscious buyers will also appreciate its unique color options.\n\nOnePlus phones aren't as common as those from Google and Samsung, but they are often worth considering. The company's latest flagship goes spec-for-spec with today's leading phones in terms of its display, battery life, performance, and camera. It even sees OnePlus dipping its toe into AI and supports wired charging speeds of up to 80W via OnePlus' proprietary power block.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 is ideal if you want something a little off the beaten path. OnePlus makes consistently good phones with genuinely useful software that will receive four years of OS upgrades. If you're budget-conscious, the OnePlus 13 also undercuts comparable options from Google and Samsung in price.\n\nThe TCL Flip 3 is an excellent voice phone with a removable battery, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a USB-C charging port. It also features a 2MP camera, which is useful in a pinch. Wi-Fi connectivity and email access can help keep you in the communications loop.\n\nIf you aren't interested in owning a smartphone, the affordable TCL Flip 3 confidently performs basic phone functions. The speakerphone and earpiece sound quite clear, too.\n\nSign up for the  Fully Mobilized  newsletter to get our top mobile stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nSign up for the  Fully Mobilized  newsletter to get our top mobile stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nBy clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our  Terms of Use  and  Privacy Policy .\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nYour subscription has been confirmed.

No matter what phone you buy, it's a paperweight unless you have reliable wireless coverage. You should choose a carrier with fair prices and the best coverage in your area.\n\nIf you're interested in performance and live in a metro area, pay strict attention to where the major carriers have \"mid-band\" 5G (also called  C-band ) and use phones supporting that technology.\n\nUScellular is currently available throughout the US, though much of its coverage is provided via partner networks. Meanwhile, Boost Mobile covers a good portion of the country with its 5G-first service.\n\nPlenty of virtual operators also use the big three networks for service but provide lower monthly rates, cheaper international calls, or other benefits. They're typically better for less intensive users, and some don't even have family plans.\n\nMint Mobile (on T-Mobile), Consumer Cellular (on AT&T), and Spectrum Mobile (on Verizon) all received higher ratings in our  Readers\u2019 Choice survey  than the companies that host their services.\n\nAT&T owns Cricket, Dish owns Boost Mobile, T-Mobile owns Metro by T-Mobile and Mint Mobile, Verizon owns Visible, and Google owns Google Fi (which  also  runs on T-Mobile). Verizon also owns Simple Mobile, Straight Talk, Total Wireless, and Tracfone. We spotlight some of our favorite virtual operators in our roundup of  the best cheap phone plans . We also have a story on  the best cheap phones .\n\nIf you're on T-Mobile, you should use a mid-band 5G-compatible phone. That's an easy choice\u2014all T-Mobile 5G phones are mid-band-compatible now.\n\nTo access AT&T's C-band network, any modern Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, or Google Pixel will do. Many of Motorola\u2019s US phones also support AT&T C-band.\n\nIf you're in one of Verizon's C-band areas, upgrading to a C-band-compatible 5G phone is a good move. The carrier's ultra-wideband network also provides super-fast mmWave 5G in select locations. If you are in one of those areas and want to take advantage, make sure your phone has that support.\n\nYou can find more 5G recommendations on our list of  the best 5G phones .\n\nCarriers sometimes have confusing service and pricing plans, so  unlocked phones  are as relevant and invaluable as ever.\n\nUnlocked phones are those you buy from a third-party store or directly from the manufacturer; they aren't tied to a specific carrier. Usually, you can use them with AT&T or T-Mobile. But some popular unlocked phones work on Verizon as well. For the most flexibility, look for a recent Apple iPhone, Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S or Z flagship, or high-end Motorola Edge phone. If you use a low-cost MVNO service, ensure your unlocked phone is compatible; some MVNOs don't support phones that should work on their networks.\n\nIn the past, unlocked 4G phones typically worked on all the major carriers, but 5G phones are different. Apple, Google, and Samsung's 5G phones usually work on every major US carrier, but many other brands either have limited band support or are only certified for specific carriers.\n\nThere's actually less diversity in smartphone platforms and designs than ever.  Android  and  iOS  are the two remaining major smartphone platforms, both in US sales and in the availability of third-party apps. The iPhone has a well-developed  App Store  and some of the best media features. But Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem can feel stifling to some, though iOS is more customizable than ever. Android handsets have more variety, and the OS lets you customize nearly everything to tailor your phone to you. But it can also mean carrier bloatware you can't remove, and less consistent OS updates. Google and Samsung provide up to seven years of OS updates and security fixes. If you want an Android phone for the long run, consider those two manufacturers.\n\nStrictly interested in Android? Head over to our roundup of the\u00a0 best Android phones .\u00a0Baffled by the variety of iPhones? Here's how to decide  which iPhone to buy . And if you want to document the world around you with your phone, we've also rounded up the\u00a0 best camera phones .\n\nSome people still use simpler phones, even though the number of choices is limited. The top reasons to consider these models are their lower prices, ease of use, and often cheaper associated service plans (because mobile data often isn't a factor). You'll find some great deals for voice-only plans on virtual carriers such as TracFone and Consumer Cellular.\n\nUnlike smartphones, feature phones are a matter of \"what you see is what you get.\" They don't receive software upgrades or run thousands of apps. Wireless network coverage is always the biggest factor, but individual phones can vary in reception, earpiece quality, transmission quality through the microphone, and sidetone (the echo of your voice that helps prevent you from yelling at the other person on the line). A phone with middling to poor reception quality can be almost impossible to use in a marginal coverage area. In contrast, one with excellent reception can make the best of the little signal available.\n\nFor more, see our picks for  the best phones for seniors  and our roundup of  the best phones for kids .\n\nThe best time to buy a new phone is when you need one. If your phone dies on the pavement, get whatever is available that best meets your needs. But if you're watching your budget or riding the cutting edge, a little knowledge and planning can save you from buying a phone that's about to be discounted or replaced with something newer and cooler.\n\nFor instance, Google's flagship Pixels came out in August. Apple released the iPhone 17 models in September. Samsung introduced its new Galaxy S series in January and Galaxy Z folding phones in July. Motorola has been sticking to a spring cadence for its folding phones, while OnePlus announced its latest flagship in January.\n\nWe update this story every time we review a new phone worth a spot on the list, so it changes often.

Technology has been my passion and hobby since I was a child. I\u2019ve covered tech professionally for over 15 years at outlets including The Apple Blog, This Week in Tech, and CNET.\n\nI\u2019ve written and presented information about hundreds of phones, tablets, smart home devices, fitness gadgets, technology business dealings, congressional hearings, and a whole lot more.\n\nI enjoy putting advancements in technology in simple-to-understand language with context that explains why it matters or not.\n\nMy daily driver phone of several years is the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G. I wound up with a Note after I found myself writing ideas on bar napkins while my old phone (a Pixel) sat unused. I looked at it and wondered, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I write ON my phone?\u201d\n\nMy choice of computer varies with whatever task I\u2019m doing. If I\u2019m editing video, I\u2019m using my M1 Mac mini. If I\u2019m just casually browsing or writing, any machine with a quality keyboard works for me. I\u2019ve been known to write things using my Note 20 or an iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard.\n\nI also enjoy having smart home products in my apartment. I\u2019ve been in both the Amazon and Google ecosystems, but mostly use Google Home devices at this point. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time making sure that this smart apartment easily works for my family. That way, I can sneak more and more tech toys into my home without arousing the suspicion of my spouse.\n\nI\u2019m a Mobile Analyst at PCMag, which means I cover wireless phones, plans, tablets, ereaders, and a whole lot more. I\u2019ve always loved technology and have been forming opinions on consumer electronics since childhood. Prior to joining PCMag, I covered TVs and home entertainment at CNET, served as the tech and electronics reviews fellow at Insider, and began my career by writing laptop reviews as an intern at Tom's Hardware. I am also a professional actor with credits in film, television, and theater.\n\nI\u2019ve written countless reviews on the latest tech\u2014including ereaders, laptops, smartwatches, streaming devices, tablets, and TVs.\n\nI\u2019ve appeared in numerous videos discussing the latest tech\n\nI am a professional actor with membership in both SAG-AFTRA and Actors Equity Association.\n\nI\u2019ve been an Apple fan for a long time. I use an iPhone 14 Pro and I don\u2019t plan to upgrade to the iPhone 15 Pro any time soon. I like to hold on to my phones for a few years. Maybe I'll upgrade if Apple sells a flip phone.\n\nI use two different Apple computers in my daily life. I recently bought a maxed-out 15-inch MacBook Air for work and other activities. Despite my brand-new computer, I can\u2019t quit using my 2012 MacBook Pro. It still works flawlessly and houses my large collection of ebooks. When traveling, I often use my 10.5-inch iPad Pro and Logitech keyboard case for streaming television and light internet use.\n\nBut my favorite piece of tech is my Kindle Paperwhite. I use it every day and it comes with me wherever I go. I read both physical and digital books, but the Paperwhite is currently my favorite ereader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering lab-based, independent reviews of the latest\n            products and services.

No matter what phone you buy, it's a paperweight unless you have reliable wireless coverage.

Meanwhile, Boost Mobile covers a good portion of the country with its 5G-first service.</p> <p>Plenty of virtual operators also use the big three networks for service but provide lower monthly rates, cheaper international calls, or other benefits. They're typically better for less intensive users, and some don't even have family plans. </p> <p>Mint Mobile (on T-Mobile), Consumer Cellular (on AT&amp;T), and Spectrum Mobile (on Verizon) all received higher ratings in our <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/articles/readers-choice-2025-mobile-carriers-phones-and-tablets\" target=\"_self\">Readers\u2019 Choice survey</a> than the companies that host their services.</p> <p>AT&amp;T owns Cricket, Dish owns Boost Mobile, T-Mobile owns Metro by T-Mobile and Mint Mobile, Verizon owns Visible, and Google owns Google Fi (which also runs on T-Mobile).

That's an easy choice\u2014all T-Mobile 5G phones are mid-band-compatible now.</p> <p>To access AT&amp;T's C-band network, any modern Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, or Google Pixel will do. Many of Motorola\u2019s US phones also support AT&amp;T C-band.</p> <p>If you're in one of Verizon's C-band areas, upgrading to a C-band-compatible 5G phone is a good move. The carrier's ultra-wideband network also provides super-fast mmWave 5G in select locations. If you are in one of those areas and want to take advantage, make sure your phone has that support.</p> <p>You can find more 5G recommendations on our list of <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-5g-phones\" target=\"_self\">the best 5G phones</a>.</p>"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Should You Get an Unlocked Phone?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>Carriers sometimes have confusing service and pricing plans, so <a href=\"/picks/the-best-unlocked-phones\" target=\"_self\">unlocked phones</a> are as relevant and invaluable as ever.</p> <p>Unlocked phones are those you buy from a third-party store or directly from the manufacturer; they aren't tied to a specific carrier. Usually, you can use them with AT&amp;T or T-Mobile. But some popular unlocked phones work on Verizon as well. For the most flexibility, look for a recent Apple iPhone, Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S or Z flagship, or high-end Motorola Edge phone. If you use a low-cost MVNO service, ensure your unlocked phone is compatible; some MVNOs don't support phones that should work on their networks. </p> <p>In the past, unlocked 4G phones typically worked on all the major carriers, but 5G phones are different. Apple, Google, and Samsung's 5G phones usually work on every major US carrier, but many other brands either have limited band support or are only certified for specific carriers.</p>"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What Is the Best Smartphone?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>There's actually less diversity in smartphone platforms and designs than ever. <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/google-android-16\" target=\"_self\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-ios-18\" target=\"_self\">iOS</a> are the two remaining major smartphone platforms, both in US sales and in the availability of third-party apps.

But Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem can feel stifling to some, though iOS is more customizable than ever. Android handsets have more variety, and the OS lets you customize nearly everything to tailor your phone to you. But it can also mean carrier bloatware you can't remove, and less consistent OS updates. Google and Samsung provide up to seven years of OS updates and security fixes.

The top reasons to consider these models are their lower prices, ease of use, and often cheaper associated service plans (because mobile data often isn't a factor). You'll find some great deals for voice-only plans on virtual carriers such as TracFone and Consumer Cellular.</p> <p>Unlike smartphones, feature phones are a matter of \"what you see is what you get.\" They don't receive software upgrades or run thousands of apps. Wireless network coverage is always the biggest factor, but individual phones can vary in reception, earpiece quality, transmission quality through the microphone, and sidetone (the echo of your voice that helps prevent you from yelling at the other person on the line). A phone with middling to poor reception quality can be almost impossible to use in a marginal coverage area. In contrast, one with excellent reception can make the best of the little signal available.</p> <p>For more, see our picks for <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-phones-for-seniors\" target=\"_self\">the best phones for seniors</a> and our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-best-phones-for-kids\" target=\"_self\">the best phones for kids</a>.</p>"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What's the Best Time to Buy a New Phone?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>The best time to buy a new phone is when you need one.
