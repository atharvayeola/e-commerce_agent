And even though it takes some trial and error to find the right pair for your feet and goals, the payoff is real: You\u2019ll have shoes that lay the groundwork for a comfortable, rewarding, and enduring pursuit \u2014 whether you\u2019re running primarily for your health or for personal bests.\n\nFor this guide, we\u2019ve gathered advice and insight from eight experts, read dozens of studies, and run more than 5,000 miles over the years. The focus here is on go-to shoes for everyday runs. We take a look at the  two main running shoe types  (neutral and stability), the  anatomy of a running shoe , and  how a shoe should fit .\n\nTo find your best running shoes, you\u2019ll likely need to try on several different pairs, either at your local running store (where you can leverage staff expertise to help you find the ideal fit) or in your living room (if you prefer to shop online). If you\u2019re ordering from home, consider retailers that have solid return policies, such as  Fleet Feet ,  REI ,  Road Runner Sports ,  Running Warehouse , and  Zappos .\n\nTo help inspire your search, we have recommendations for  women\u2019s and men\u2019s models and sizes , including  dependable neutral trainers ,  stability shoes with various amounts of cushion , and  a low-drop option .\n\nThese light daily trainers are good for long and short runs and have noticeable propulsion and plenty of bounce.\n\nThis is the same shoe, in men\u2019s sizing.\n\nA drastic redesign has improved the smooth and cushy ride of a longtime favorite shoe.\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nThis is the same shoe, in men\u2019s sizing.\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nThis is the rare zero-drop shoe that feels springy but still flexible underfoot.

Aim for at least a thumb\u2019s width of space between your longest toe and the end of your shoe.\n\nIf possible, visit a specialty running store for a fitting. Try on a bunch of shoes, and go back to the pairs that felt the best.\n\nComfort is key. If a shoe feels off when you try it on for the first time, it most likely won\u2019t feel much better on a run.\n\nConsider what you want most from your shoes. Is it distance? Think cushioning. Speed? Look for weight and responsiveness.\n\nThese light daily trainers are good for long and short runs and have noticeable propulsion and plenty of bounce.\n\nThis is the same shoe, in men\u2019s sizing.\n\nIf you want  neutral running shoes , start your search with the Asics Novablast 5 ( women\u2019s ,  men\u2019s ). We also like the New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080v14 ( women\u2019s ,  men\u2019s ) and the Nike Pegasus 41 ( women\u2019s ,  men\u2019s ).\n\nA drastic redesign has improved the smooth and cushy ride of a longtime favorite shoe.\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nThis is the same shoe, in men\u2019s sizing.\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for  stability shoes , a good starting point is the Saucony Guide 17 ( women\u2019s ,  men\u2019s ), a trainer with ample cushioning and more zip than we expected. We also like the New Balance Fresh Foam X 860v14 ( women\u2019s ,  men\u2019s ), which isn\u2019t as bouncy but feels plenty sturdy and supportive.\n\nThis is the rare zero-drop shoe that feels springy but still flexible underfoot. An ample toe box creates a comfortable fit that helps prevent blisters and hot spots.\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nThis is the same shoe, in men\u2019s sizing.\n\nYou save $19 (17%)\n\nprice may vary by color or style\n\nIf you prefer  low-drop running shoes , consider the Altra Escalante 4 ( women\u2019s ,  men\u2019s ), which performed solidly on roads and in off-road conditions during our testing. This shoe has a good amount of cushioning and comes as close to mimicking a barefoot shoe as we\u2019ve seen on a zero-drop trainer.\n\nSince 2017, Wirecutter running-shoe testers have logged more than 5,500 total miles, with feet on the ground in places such as Miami, New York City, Portland, Maine, and Portland, Oregon.\n\nWe chatted with eight experts to get their takes on what matters \u2014 and what doesn\u2019t \u2014 in a running shoe\u2019s design and how to find ones that are right for you.\n\nColleen Brough , DPT, is an assistant professor of rehabilitation and regenerative medicine at  Columbia University Irving Medical Center  and director of the  Columbia RunLab . Brough answered our questions on the relationship between running shoes and injuries, as well as how tools like gait analysis factor into finding the right pair of shoes.\n\nJolan Browne , DPT, is a senior physical therapist at  NYU\u2019s Running Lab  at NYU Langone Orthopedic Center. Browne explained foot strike (heel versus midfoot versus forefoot) and the biomechanics of running for us.\n\nCarson Caprara  is senior vice president of footwear at  Brooks . Caprara provided insight on how a large running-shoe company strategizes its approach to shoe updates and innovations.\n\nGolden Harper  is co-founder of  Altra Running . Harper\u2019s family ran a specialty running store, so he started deconstructing shoes at a young age. As an adult, he created a shoe with reduced heel cushioning for himself and his friends (he said this shoe felt more natural and comfortable). That shoe led to the founding of the shoe company Altra, which specializes in  no-drop shoes . (VF Corporation, the Colorado-based company that owns The North Face and Timberland, bought Altra for an undisclosed amount in 2018.)\n\nMelanie Kann  is a New York City\u2013based running coach and former running-shoe salesperson.\n\nPaul Langer,  DPM, is a podiatrist at  Twin Cities Orthopedics  and part owner of running-shoe store  Fleet Feet Minneapolis . Langer helped us make sense of the current research on how running shoes can affect (or not affect) runners\u2019 efficiency and injury rates.\n\nJim McDannald,  DPM, is a podiatrist and running coach based in Montreal, and he previously wrote running-related reviews for Wirecutter.\n\nMariska van Sprundel  is a science writer and author of  Running Smart: How Science Can Improve Your Endurance and Performance . Van Sprundel answered our questions about the factors one should consider when choosing a pair of running shoes.\n\nWe also pored over peer-reviewed research about running shoes and injuries, and considered several articles on road-running shoes, including stories from  Runner\u2019s World  and  The New York Times .\n\nAccording to the  Sports & Fitness Industry Association , approximately 51.1 million people in the US laced up their trainers for some form of running or jogging in 2024.\n\nNo matter where you fall on the running spectrum, the right shoes can make all the difference in your relationship with the sport. A good pair is arguably the most important tool a runner needs to train comfortably and consistently; ideally, once your shoes are on your feet,  you shouldn\u2019t have to think too much about them . The wrong pair can bring on blisters, bruised toenails, or worse.\n\nFor this guide we considered go-to shoes for everyday running, either outside or on a treadmill. The shoes described here would be appropriate both for recreational runners (whose runs are usually of similar distance and intensity) and for competitive runners (those seeking a workhorse shoe for easy or recovery runs). Some of these shoes may not be ideal for long runs of more than an hour (where more cushioning might be appreciated) or for racing or speed work (where light weight and responsiveness are important). That\u2019s not to say you couldn\u2019t use the shoes we recommend for either or both purposes \u2014 over the years many of our testers have happily used our picks for marathon training as well as at the track.\n\nIdeally, once your shoes are on your feet, you shouldn\u2019t have to think too much about them.\n\nThe shoes in this guide would also be fine choices for those who walk for fitness and for injured runners who are eager to keep moving. These running shoes may not be your first choice for use at the gym, however: For that purpose, many people prefer shoes that are flatter (for weightlifting) or that have less side-to-side support (for easier movement in every direction, such as for an aerobics or boot-camp class).\n\nMany running-shoe companies divide their shoes into two main categories: neutral and stability (or \u201cmotion-control\u201d) shoes. A neutral shoe won\u2019t affect your normal gait, but it will provide you with added support and cushion to protect your feet from the ground. Stability shoes, on the other hand, have denser foam along the arch of the foot. They may also have a  stiffer heel , which reduces the foot\u2019s side-to-side movement.\n\nEveryone\u2019s feet naturally pronate (roll to the inner edge) or supinate (roll to the outer edge) during each running stride. Pronation allows your foot to adapt to the landing surface, and supination propels you forward, according to podiatrist Paul Langer and physical therapist Jolan Browne. Both pronation and supination are  biomechanically necessary for running . Running-shoe companies make both stability and neutral shoes because of the long-held idea that some people\u2019s feet roll in too far and need correction. This is called overpronation, and it may contribute to pain in the feet, ankles, and knees.\n\nAccording to our experts, however, overpronators make up a very small subset of the population. Langer explained pronation as a bell curve, with most people falling in the middle of the curve (those who won\u2019t need extra stability while running) and a relative few falling at either extreme (oversupination and overpronation). Langer and fellow podiatrist Jim McDannald pointed out that there is no medical definition of overpronation. Langer said that overpronation \u201cis an overused term, especially in the running retail setting, that most likely came out of some of the early biomechanics and sports medicine textbooks in the 1960s. The term was not based on any particular study and never quantified. It really was just accepted dogma that was then perpetuated.\u201d\n\nPronation allows your foot to adapt to the landing surface, and supination propels you forward.\n\nEven if you do overpronate, the scientific jury is still out on whether  shoes can actually reduce the risk of injury . \u201cRunning shoes don\u2019t, and can\u2019t, prevent injuries, per se,\u201d said Colleen Brough, director of the Columbia RunLab.\n\nIf you shop for shoes at a brick-and-mortar running store, you may be offered a running-gait analysis, usually done on a treadmill. A store employee will likely analyze a video recording of your gait, in order to identify biomechanical glitches that could provide clues to which type of shoe might work best for you. Brough, who conducts gait analyses at the Columbia RunLab, said an in-store analysis can be beneficial even if it isn\u2019t conducted by a biomechanics or medical professional. But it doesn\u2019t illuminate everything. Gait analysis is \u201conly one piece\u201d of putting together a runner\u2019s full story, she said, especially if the runner has an injury history.\n\nSo how do you decide what to buy for your feet? Experts recommend that you start with neutral shoes. Move to stability shoes only if you feel like you want more support (some runners may simply prefer the feel of a less-flexible, more-stable shoe) or if a doctor or physical therapist suggests them.\n\nHeel-to-toe drop is the difference between the thickness of the shoe\u2019s sole at the heel and the thickness at the forefoot. Traditional running shoes tend to have a thicker heel than front, or a heel-to-toe drop in the 10 mm to 12 mm range. This provides more cushioning under the heel, as you can see in this diagram:\n\nApproximately 90% of race runners are heel strikers,  according  to  various studies . When heel strikers run, each foot lands heel first and then rolls through the toe. A smaller percentage of runners are midfoot or forefoot strikers, which means they land through the middle of the foot or on the toes, respectively, when they run. Most running shoes have a higher heel-to-toe drop with a thicker, cushioned heel that protects the foot during heel striking, since that design feels better for the majority-ruling heel strikers.\n\nComfort, however you define it, is the most important factor in determining whether a pair of running shoes is right for you.\n\nThe whole  foot-strike business is complicated , to say the least. Some people in the barefoot running community contend that the overly cushioned heels of modern running shoes encourage a heel-strike pattern. However, in terms of injury risk or prevention,  researchers don\u2019t agree  on whether a forefoot or midfoot strike is any better or worse than heel striking.\n\nAll of our experts did agree that your body mechanics (including your foot strike) will adapt to the shoes that are on your feet, most particularly in response to discomfort. (Brough pointed out that running shoes can help promote a different foot strike, but a change that major  isn\u2019t recommended for everyone .) In other words, if your body isn\u2019t happy as you run, it will alter its movement patterns to lessen or eliminate that unhappiness. This once again proves the point that comfort, however you define it, is the most important factor in determining whether a particular pair of running shoes is right for you. \u201cIf you\u2019re just starting a running program,\u201d Brough said, \u201cyou have to make sure no matter how fancy or expensive the running shoe is, comfort is the number one thing that dictates.\u201d\n\nIf a \u201cbarefoot but better\u201d shoe appeals to you, or if you haven\u2019t found a traditional drop shoe that you love, you might like a low-drop shoe. Plenty of heel strikers also love low-drop shoes. (Wirecutter supervising editor Ingrid Skjong, a certified personal trainer, ran in the same motion-control running shoes for years \u2014 even wearing custom orthotics to help \u201ccorrect\u201d her pronation \u2014 before doing a chunk of her training over the past couple of years in a more-minimalist low-drop shoe.) But if you plan to make the switch, expect to feel a big difference. \u201cIf you\u2019re used to cushioning, and you switch to a minimalist shoe without conditioning your calves and Achilles tendons before the switch, you have a higher risk of getting yourself an injury,\u201d said Mariska van Sprundel, author of  Running Smart: How Science Can Improve Your Endurance and Performance.\n\nEase into a new low-drop pair by starting out with shorter runs. (This is a wise approach with any new pair of shoes.)\n\nComfort is, of course, subjective. Still, there are some general guidelines you can use to help ensure that running shoes fit you correctly:\n\nBe flexible about sizing:  Common running-shoe advice is to buy a shoe that\u2019s a half size or even a full size up from your street-shoe size, to account for your feet swelling while you run. However, after talking to brand representatives and industry experts, we learned that shoe sizing is more of an art than a science. Shoes are typically designed around what\u2019s called a \u201clast.\u201d A last is a three-dimensional form that mimics the shape of a human foot, and it\u2019s created in a sample size based on the sizing scale in a company\u2019s country of origin (for example, with Brooks the sample size is a US men\u2019s 9 or a US women\u2019s 8\u00bd). From there, the additional sizes are scaled, and international size conversions are marked based on a company\u2019s proprietary charts. Therefore, every brand\u2019s sizes are a little different. The bottom line: Use your normal running-shoe size as a starting point, but don\u2019t be shy about sizing up (or, more rarely, down) to find your best fit.\n\nPick the right width and length:  Your feet expand and swell when you run, so wearing shoes that are too short or too narrow is a recipe for blisters and lost toenails. To avoid this, make sure you have at least a thumb\u2019s width of space between your longest toe and the end of your shoe \u2014 no matter the size of the shoe. Most people will also want enough room in the toe box for the toes to spread wide and the nails not to touch the fabric inside. A snug fit around the heel is also important, to prevent your shoe from sliding up and down through the foot strike.\n\nMake sure you have at least a thumb\u2019s width of space between your longest toe and the end of your shoe.\n\nCompare shoes head-to-head:  You may choose to order a few pairs of shoes online, with the intent of returning the ones that don\u2019t fit. If it\u2019s possible, however, we recommend that you first get fitted by a knowledgeable salesperson at a specialty running shop. Try on a bunch of shoes, and then go back to the pairs that seemed the most comfortable. To compare, put one model on one foot and another on the other foot, and do a lap around the store. Then switch shoes and do another lap. \u201cAsk yourself which shoes you were least aware of and buy those,\u201d said running coach Melanie Kann. You should also play around with the laces. Laces that are too tight or too loose \u2014 in the right or wrong places \u2014 can significantly affect the feel of the shoes. (Take note of the material the laces are made of, as well as their shape and general feel. They should tie securely, without slipping.) A  heel-lock lacing technique  can keep feet from sliding up in back, whereas nontraditional toe lacing can provide more spreading room in front.\n\nShop with a goal in mind:  Consider what you want most out of the pair of shoes you\u2019re buying. If it\u2019s distance, pay attention to cushioning. If it\u2019s speed, focus on the weight and responsiveness. \u201cThink about where you are now, and where you want to be in the next 300 to 500 miles,\u201d Kann said. That\u2019s approximately how long a pair of shoes should last. (Along with supporting your training, choosing a shoe that you\u2019ll wear happily for its entire lifespan\u00a0is the best approach from an environmental perspective.)\n\n\u201cAsk yourself which shoes you were the least aware of and buy those.\u201d \u2014Melanie Kann, running coach\n\nThis may mean you\u2019ll want to have more than one pair of shoes in your rotation. Jim McDannald, previously a health technology writer at Wirecutter, pointed out that wearing the same shoe for every run can affect mechanics. \u201cIt\u2019s good to throw your body a curve and [make it] adapt to another shoe, which can prevent overuse-injury issues in the future,\u201d he explained. If you\u2019re running on consecutive days, you can also let one pair of shoes \u201crest\u201d while you run in the other. This allows the cushioning to fully spring back. (We are fans of rotating more than one pair of shoes. But there are differing opinions on whether the cushioning of a shoe really needs a break.) This strategy is also useful for when your primary pair gets wet on a run and needs time to dry out.\n\nAnd don\u2019t just assume you can buy the newest version of your current shoes and be all set. \u201cPeople can get hung up on \u2018that\u2019s my favorite [model],\u2019 which can be problematic because shoe manufacturers change things up,\u201d McDannald said. Kann added: \u201cGet fitted every year or two. Your body changes, and shoes change.\u201d\n\nCarson Caprara, senior vice president of footwear at Brooks, told us the company\u2019s most popular shoes undergo annual tweaks (anything from a change to the geometry to a switched-up material in the upper to a slightly altered design). As a result, the company releases n", "excerpt": "We independently review everything we recommend. When you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.
