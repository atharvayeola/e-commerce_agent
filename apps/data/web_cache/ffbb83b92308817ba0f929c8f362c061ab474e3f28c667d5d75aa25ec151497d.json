Whether you\u2019re reheating leftovers, defrosting ingredients, or cooking a quick meal, a microwave is an all-rounder you can rely on to save time. With new technology and features, there are multiple types of microwaves available on the market. Finding a suitable one might be overwhelming, but we\u2019ve got you covered with this perfect guide.\n\nKnow Your Options\n\nCountertop Microwaves:  If you have a compact kitchen, then a countertop microwave might do the job for you. Most commonly used among other types, this variant fits most budgets and caters conveniently to daily cooking needs\n\nOver-The-Range Microwaves:  Combining a microwave with a range hood, this variant is an excellent choice for maximizing function and saving space. Adding a good lighting and venting system can make an over-the-top microwave a great addition to your kitchen.\n\nBuilt-In Microwaves:  Offering a sleek and integrated look, this variant usually sits above an oven or inside a kitchen island. A perfect built-in microwave usually blends into your kitchen\u2019s design with a drop-down door for maximum convenience.\n\nConvection Microwaves:  Combining the quick cooking of a microwave with the browning and crisping capabilities of a convection oven, this is the ultimate versatile variant. An ideal convection microwave comes with multiple cooking modes and pre-set programs for a range of cooking tasks.\n\nWhile matching your requirements to the perfect type of microwave oven is necessary, it is equally important to consider other features like energy consumption, size, capacity, and safety. Let\u2019s take a quick look at them:\n\nSize and Capacity:  If you frequently cook larger dishes, considering the interior capacity of the microwave oven should top your checklist. Additionally, measure the space in your kitchen to ensure a proper fit with proper installation facilities.\n\nEnergy Consumption:  A microwave oven\u2019s cooking power is determined by its wattage consumption. High-watt variants are often multi-functional but also translate to higher energy consumption. Make sure you evaluate your options based on your needs, capacity, and volume.\n\nDesign and Safety:  When considering safety features, important factors to look for include child lock features to prevent accidental operation and a proper ventilation system to avoid overheating risks. Additionally, look for variants that offer an intuitive control panel and easy-to-use buttons to enhance your overall cooking experience.\n\nShopping for a microwave oven doesn\u2019t have to be overwhelming. However, taking your time to make the right choice will help you enjoy quick and hassle-free cooking for years to come. Remember to maintain a checklist of your cooking needs, consider safety measures, and assess your kitchen space before you go for a variant that aligns with your lifestyle, and you\u2019ll be good to go.\n\nFAQs:\n\nQ: What is the difference between a convection microwave and a regular microwave?\n\nA: convection microwave combines the functions of a microwave and a convection oven, allowing you to brown and crisp your food in addition to quick cooking. A regular microwave, on the other hand, solely uses microwaves to cook or heat food.\n\nQ: Can I use metal utensils in a microwave oven?\n\nA: Metal utensils should not be used in microwave ovens as they can cause sparks and damage the appliance. Instead, use microwave-safe cookware and utensils made of glass, ceramic, or microwave-safe plastic.\n\nQ: How do I clean a microwave oven?\n\nA: To clean a microwave oven, wipe the interior with a damp cloth or sponge. For stubborn stains or food residues, you can use a mixture of water and mild detergent. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrubbing pads that may damage the interior surface.\n\nSponsored", "excerpt": "week is here! \n Join   for  free   & save with BIG deals today. Ends 10/11.
