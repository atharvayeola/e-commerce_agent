Other retailers are planning their own deal events at the same time, so there's a very good chance that these PCs will be discounted. I recommend holding off until next week to make a final decision.\n\nOctober 6, 2025:  Our top 9 picks haven't changed, but I've made note of any early discounts already live ahead of Prime Big Deal Days. \u2014 Cale Hunt\n\nBest overall\n\nBest overall\n\nLenovo knocks it out of the park with the outstanding Yoga 9i for 2025.

That doesn't just happen accidentally.\n\nThe countless hours we've put into testing hundreds of Windows laptops from all of the big names (and some smaller names) has resulted in a clear understanding of what works for different users and what's best left on the shelf, no matter the buyer.\n\n\u2705Reliable and modern build quality \u2705Strong performance and battery life \u2705Color-accurate display with additional perks \u2705Features like varied port selection, high-res camera, clear audio\n\nTesting laptops properly takes time and takes some specialized tools, but our team of reviewers is well-equipped for the challenge. Our reviewers essentially \"adopt\" a laptop before writing the review, keeping it as a main driver until enough information is gathered to clearly decide why it works well and what areas can be improved.\n\nReviewers test in every instance: build quality and design, including ports; display resolution, color, and performance; battery life and performance on or off AC power; overall system performance from CPU, GPU, RAM, and SSD; and additional features like camera quality, audio design, and input hardware.\n\n\u2022 CPU:  Central Processing Unit, the centerpiece of your laptop \u2022 GPU:  Graphics Processing Unit, handles display output and can be integrated or discrete \u2022 RAM:  Random Access Memory, used by the CPU and/or GPU for temporary storage \u2022 SSD:  Solid State Drive, used for system storage in modern laptops \u2022 OS:  Operating System, in this case Windows\n\nTo summarize, I'm looking for laptops that are durable and built to a high standard, laptops that offer the performance and battery life necessary for their intended user base, laptops with color-accurate and clear displays, and laptops with useful extra features like a high-res webcam with privacy shutter, biometric security, strong speakers, and comfortable keyboard.\n\nOur guidelines on  how we test and review laptops at Windows Central  show a more detailed breakdown of everything we test in a laptop, but you can rest assured that we're carefully analyzing each laptop we review to discover what it's all about.\n\nWhy you can trust Windows Central\n \n \n \n \n Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.  Find out more about how we test .\n\n\u2705 You want the best premium convertible Windows laptop on the market. \u2705 You consume a lot of media content like video and want excellent sound and display. \u2705 You're a creator who wants a color-accurate display for photo editing and light video editing. \u2705  You want just the finest Windows 11 PC with all the bells and whistles.\n\n\u274c You primarily game or need a discrete NVIDIA GPU. \u274c You need built-in 4G LTE or 5G mobility. \u274c  You don't need a convertible laptop. \u274c  You want the best battery life possible.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e  Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Gen 10)  is our top overall pick for best Windows laptop thanks to a host of premium features, strong Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) CPU performance, and your choice of 2.8K or 4K OLED touch displays.\n\nLenovo's latest version of the Yoga 9i 2-in-1 \u2014 now in its tenth generation \u2014 is our choice for the overall best Windows laptop. Lenovo continues a \"don't fix what isn't broken\" approach to the Gen 10 model, keeping the gorgeous design mostly the same.\n\nIt still has soft, rounded edges and a 360-degree soundbar hinge between the display and body, and it retains the Cosmic Blue color that first arrived with the Gen 9 models. The laptop has four speakers, each producing 2W of output with Dolby Atmos tuning.\n\nThe soundbar hinge ties in perfectly with the 14-inch display options for those who enjoy watching TV and movies on their laptops, as the speakers are always front-facing, whether in tablet, laptop, or tent mode. It's a one-of-a-kind design that makes it a media powerhouse.\n\nWhether you want a 2.8K or UHD+ resolution, you get an OLED touch panel with 400 nits brightness, 100% DCI-P3 color, Dolby Vision, and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 500 support. The 2.8K model has a 120Hz refresh rate, while the UHD+ model tops at 60Hz. These displays are also ideal for creators who need color accuracy and plenty of pixels.\n\nAbove the display is a 5MP webcam with an IR sensor for Windows Hello and a privacy shutter. As for ports, you're looking at dual  Thunderbolt 4 ,  USB-C  (10Gbps),  USB -A (10Gbps), and a 3.5mm audio jack. The laptop does not have optional 5G/4G LTE connectivity, but it does have cutting-edge  Wi-Fi 7  for fast and reliable speeds.\n\nThe tenth-gen models jumped to Intel's Core Ultra 7 256V and 258V processors (CPU), which include a  Neural Processing Unit (NPU)  with 47 TOPS of power for local AI tasks. That's enough to give it access to Copilot+ tools in Windows 11.\n\nThese chips also include much-improved  Intel Arc  140V integrated graphics. The system delivers snappy performance thanks to up to 32GB of LPDDR5x RAM and a 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD; we haven't finished testing the Gen 10 model yet, but battery life looks to have slightly improved thanks to the more efficient chips.\n\nSo, why is the Lenovo Yoga 9i 14 (Gen 10) the best?\n\nIt perfectly showcases everything that the ultimate Windows (non-gaming) laptop represents. Amazing audio, display, keyboard, touchpad, design, and a 2-in-1 with pen support. The Lenovo Yoga 9i 14 (Gen 10)  does it all.\n\nAt the time of my most recent update, I'm seeing  discounts up to 23% on the Yoga 9i 14 (Gen 10) at Lenovo's official site .\n\nAttribute\n\nRating\n\nNotes\n\nValue\n\n4.5/5\n\nDay 1 prices for Lenovo are always expensive, but the company routinely runs HUGE sales making its laptops much  more affordable.\n\nDesign\n\n5/5\n\nLenovo's famed \"speaker bar\" is unmatched and the laptop's rounded edges make it very comfortable to use.\n\nPerformance\n\n5/5\n\nWhile we're Qualcomm fans around here, the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H\u00a0is on the more powerful end of modern laptop CPUs especially for this form factor.\n\nBattery\n\n4/5\n\nBattery life could be better, as with most Intel Core Ultra Gen 1 laptops, but 5 to 7 hours is realistic.\n\nDisplay\n\n5/5\n\nStunning and perfect in every way.\n\nOur expert review:\n\n\u2705  You need a reliable, simple laptop for years of casual computing.\n\n\u2705  You're looking for the lightest clamshell laptop possible.\n\n\u2705  You want a laptop that can reliably last all day.\n\n\u274c  You need a lot of power or want to game.\n\n\u274c  You don't want to choose between performance or memory/storage.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e  ASUS Zenbook A14  is one of the most affordable AI laptops on the market thanks to near-constant discounts. It's an excellent all-day machine for casual consumers and mobile warriors, and being as light as it is, it didn't require a single compromise. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThe ASUS Zenbook A14 blew us away when it launched, and it remains one of the most affordable AI laptops with full access to Copilot+, especially when it's on sale.\n\nPart of the laptop's thin-and-light success is owed to a \"Ceraluminum\" chassis. It's a magnesium alloy that makes the laptop feel almost fake when you pick it up, but it's far from flimsy.\n\nThe Zenbook A14 weighs 21% less than Apple's 2024 MacBook Air, but ASUS says the material is 30% lighter and 300% stronger than standard aluminum used in laptops.\n\nDespite the affordable pricing, the Zenbook A14 features a 14-inch Lumina OLED panel with perfect contrast and outstanding color. In our testing, it hit 100% sRGB and DCI-P3, falling only to 96% for AdobeRGB.\n\nThe laptop is powered by a  Qualcomm Snapdragon  X X1 chip, which scores about the same in Cinebench as the Apple M3 chip in the MacBook Pro 14. Best part? ASUS squeezes a massive 70Wh battery into the chassis, resulting in more than 12 hours of real-world life from a charge.\n\nThanks to a Qualcomm Adreno NPU, you get full access to Copilot+ tools in Windows 11.\n\nWindows Central's Zachary Boddy remarked in their  ASUS Zenbook A14 review :\n\n\"It starts with that lovely minimalist design, but not the kind of reductive minimalism that uses aesthetics to justify stripping away features. No, this is the kind of minimalist design that makes full use of absolutely every element of the laptop, and you're not losing out on features or build quality to achieve that super-light design.\"\n\n\ud83d\udc49  Read our full  ASUS Zenbook A14 review\n\nAttribute\n\nRating\n\nNotes\n\nValue\n\n4/5\n\nThe Zenbook A14's $900 model was supposed to be the killer deal, but a $100 price increase makes the debate mostly moot.\n\nDesign\n\n5/5\n\nA thin and light design that doesn't compromise on features or build quality; you really can't ask for much more from a laptop.\n\nPerformance\n\n4/5\n\nThe new entry-level Snapdragon X is cool and quick, but it's a lot easier to find its limits (especially with the GPU) than its bigger siblings.\n\nBattery\n\n5/5\n\nA humungous cell and efficient chipset make class-leading battery life possible. This is more than an all-day machine, regardless of what you do with it.\n\nDisplay\n\n4/5\n\nThis 14-inch OLED display is gorgeous, but it's not the sharpest or fastest and you'll feel that more and more as you go up to higher-end configurations.\n\nOur expert review:\n\n\u2705 You want the best laptop display you can buy. \u2705 You're willing to pay extra for something unique. \u2705 You often edit photos and video or love watching media on your laptop.\n\n\u274c You want a gaming PC. \u274c You constantly use your laptop webcam and need it to look good. \u274c  You need a convertible or 2-in-1 design.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e  Lenovo's Yoga Slim 9i 14 (Gen 10)  is a statement piece made to offer the latest design and display hardware to anyone who yearns for a premium laptop. There are some compromises in the name of luxury \u2014 just two ports? \u2014 but they pale next to everything the PC does right. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nLenovo's Yoga 9i might be the top pick here, but the Yoga Slim 9i (Gen 10) takes the title for best design.\n\nIt's one of Lenovo's flagship laptops, and its  $1,637 starting price  is certainly higher than many of the other options on this list.\n\nHowever, as Windows Central's Zachary Boddy mentions in their  Yoga Slim 9i (Gen 10) review :\n\n\"There were no surprises here, and I mean that in the best way possible. The design is just as premium as it needed to be, the display is every bit as stunning and magnificent as Lenovo claimed it would be, the performance and core experience is exactly what a high-end Windows laptop should deliver.\"\n\nIndeed, the main attraction is the 14-inch 4K OLED touch display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It's capable of hitting 750 nits brightness with HDR enabled (600 nits without), it's certified for Dolby Vision and DisplayHDR True Black 600, and it has an impressive 98% screen-to-body ratio that nearly completely eliminates the bezel.\n\nOn the flip side, you also need to be aware of some compromises that aren't as evident in other laptops, like the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14. That's especially true if you're in search of a convertible PC, as the Yoga Slim 9i is a clamshell notebook despite the name.\n\nBattery life isn't outstanding due to the OLED display \u2014 Boddy clocked it at about a six-hour real-world average \u2014 and the two Thunderbolt 4 ports are all you get for physical connectivity.\n\nAs for the webcam, it's located below the screen due to there not being enough space in the top bezel. If that doesn't work for you, you can always pick up a  great standalone webcam .\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Read our full  Lenovo Yoga Slim 9i 14 (Gen 10) review\n\nAttribute\n\nRating\n\nNotes\n\nValue\n\n4/5\n\nThere's no arguing that this laptop is incredibly expensive, but it's a unique device with luxury features.\n\nDesign\n\n4.5/5\n\nThe best of Lenovo's design comes together to create a gorgeous, sleek, and exotic laptop... With only two ports.\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5/5\n\nExcellent performance on and off the charger and finely tuned thermals is exactly what you want to see from a premium device.\n\nBattery\n\n4/5\n\nA display that absolutely tears through battery doesn't stop the Yoga Slim 9i from being decently reliable and consistent, thanks to a large cell and good optimization.\n\nDisplay\n\n5/5\n\nThe lack of VRR and the use of PWM flickering aside, this makes a great case for being the best display ever put into a 14-inch laptop.\n\nOur expert review:\n\n\u2705 You want the best Surface Pro that Microsoft has ever made. \u2705 You want the best of Windows 11 (inking, NPU for Copilot+, 2-in-1 form factor, 5G). \u2705 You're a creator, artist, student, or simply love watching movies on an OLED screen.\n\n\u274c You want to game a lot. \u274c You're a video editor who needs a discrete GPU. \u274c  You don't like the 2-in-1 form factor with removable keyboard.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e  Surface Pro 11:  The Surface Pro 11 is celebrated as one of the best Windows PCs of 2024, thanks to Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X processor, a stunning 120Hz OLED display, and the flexible Flex Keyboard. It now has exceptional performance, excellent battery life, and an outstanding 12 MP front-facing camera. It finally realizes the original vision for the Surface Pro. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAs of 2025, Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro had been around for 12 years, but it wasn\u2019t until late 2024 that we could claim that the full vision of that device was realized.\n\nThanks to its new  Qualcomm Snapdragon  X processors, the Surface Pro 11 is finally powerful  and  has great battery life. It also did not have a fan blasting all the time.\n\nTo that end, I\u2019ve used every Surface device Microsoft has made. As a fan of the Surface Pro concept, I think Microsoft did an outstanding job with its 11 th  iteration. You should trust my opinion because I still use it daily (despite having dozens of cutting-edge laptops at arm's reach).\n\nNew for 2024-2025 is the option for a gorgeous OLED display, new colors (always go for sapphire), and smaller refinements to the chassis.\n\nBut the Qualcomm Snapdragon X and X Elite chips became the heart of Surface Pro 11, making it a success and displacing Intel for the consumer models. It was the right choice.\n\nFor the first time, I felt I could leave the Surface charger at home because this thing finally gets all-day battery life, and yet it was more powerful than nearly all my Intel-based laptops, including 15-inch workstations.\n\nWhere else does Surface Pro 11 excel? Basically, everything. It has excellent audio and display and is easily the best webcam of any laptop I have tested (plus a world-facing camera).\n\nThis year's other killer feature was Microsoft\u2019s introduction of the new Surface Flex Keyboard, which I didn\u2019t know I needed. While expensive, it offers a superior haptic touchpad and Bluetooth that operates independently of the Surface Pro.\n\nAdditionally, the Surface Slim Pen is always exposed for easier access. Due to its design, the keyboard deck is also stiffer with less flex (ironic because of its name). If you can afford it, the Surface Flex Keyboard is a must-have accessory for the Surface Pro 11.\n\nThe best part? While Surface Pro 11 is better in every way, it\u2019s also $200 cheaper than the previous iteration, making it much more affordable this time.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Read our full   Surface Pro 11 review\n\nAttribute\n\nRating\n\nNotes\n\nValue\n\n4.5/5\n\nSurface devices come at a premium, but you're getting more than ever in this generation.\n\nDesign\n\n5/5\n\nThe standard for all 2-in-1 Windows PCs.\n\nPerformance\n\n5/5\n\nBests every other Surface Pro and competes with the other best Windows laptops.\n\nBattery\n\n5/5\n\n10+ hours of real-world runtime is awesome.\n\nDisplay\n\n4.5/5\n\nThe only thing the OLED display lacks is an anti-reflective finish.\n\nOur expert review:\n\n\u2705 You want a premium 14-inch convertible PC. \u2705 A bright, color-accurate OLED display is important. \u2705 You want an industry-leading keyboard and touchpad. \u2705 You want a powerful laptop that can last hours.\n\n\u274c You want a gaming laptop. \u274c You're looking for the best value possible. \u274c  You don't need a convertible design.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e  HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 (2024)  refines its predecessor and makes the chassis thinner, lighter, and the battery longer-lasting. \"Premium\" is an understatement when you see the price, but its features are the best in class. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\n\nWhen I reviewed the HP Spectre x360 14 (2024), I concluded that HP had practically p", "excerpt": "There's a perfect Windows laptop for every user, and our in-depth testing and review process will help you get the right PC.\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

I play plenty of my favorite lightweight games on integrated graphics, and the reality of modern game streaming means all you really need is a strong internet connection and a subscription to something like <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/i-finally-believe-in-the-dream-of-xbox-cloud-gaming\">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>.</p><p>However, those who want to take in more demanding titles with fancy graphics will want to pick up a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. The RTX 4060 is extremely popular thanks to its ability to handle most games on the market, though even the RTX 4050 can give you a significant boost at 1080p.</p>"}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "Question", "name": "How much RAM do I need in my laptop?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>The answer to this question again boils down to how you use your PC.

Love to load your browser up with countless tabs? Consider stretching your laptop to 16GB of RAM.</p><p>On that note, I recommend 16GB for anyone who often has multiple apps running simultaneously. Casual gamers should also consider starting at 16GB, and this amount will also be beneficial for professionals with laptops featuring extra security measures.</p><p>32GB of RAM (or more) is usually reserved for gamers, creators, video editors, engineers, developers, and other power users who won't see the extra capacity go to waste.

Microsoft's initiative to bring next-gen AI tools to Windows 11 requires an NPU with at least 40 TOPS of power.

OLED is becoming more common in laptops as costs drop, and you can regularly find premium laptops with at least one OLED display option.</p><p>Unlike IPS displays, OLED displays don't have a traditional backlight. Instead, each LED can create its own light when applied with electricity.</p><p>That eliminates backlight bleed, and it allows each individual pixel to completely go dark. Contrast is incredible, and color reproduction across gamuts is usually perfect (or very near to it).</p><p>If you often watch movies or game on your laptop, an OLED display is only going to improve your experience.</p><p>There are some downsides to OLED. They require more power, putting a bigger hit on battery life. They also have a potential for burn-in, though this issue has mostly been negated in laptops thanks to onboard software that minimizes the risk.
