The best options can track exercise, monitor advanced health metrics, and act as a handy second screen to your smartphone.\n\nThe good news? All the major brands have now delivered refreshes of their smartwatch lineups for 2025. So, not only do you have fresh options from Apple, Samsung, Google, Garmin, and Huawei to consider, but you also have the opportunity to purchase older generations at discounted rates.\n\nOur team is still putting the likes of the Apple Watch Ultra 3, Apple Watch Series 11, Garmin Venu 4, and Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 through their paces ahead of their full, in-depth reviews. And though  we still rank the Apple Watch Series 10 as the best smartwatch for most people , this will likely change over the coming weeks once verdicts are posted in full.\n\nIf you\u2019re an Android user in need of an alternative,   we currently recommend looking at the  Samsung Galaxy Watch 8  or  Google Pixel Watch 3/4  range.\n\nHere at Wareable, we\u2019ve thoroughly tested and reviewed every major smartwatch on the market over the last decade\u2014and our reviews are regarded as some of the most stringent in the industry. Read on for our hand-picked recommendations of the best smartwatches.\n\nTrying to rank the top smartwatches is a complex task; no two devices are the same, nor are the people using them. With this in mind, we utilize our expertise to offer our opinion on the watches that fit the categories listed in the summary below.\n\nUltimately, this buyer\u2019s guide builds upon our full, in-depth reviews, which involve testing a device over several weeks (and often longer). We rigorously analyze the design, features, health monitoring, activity tracking, and manufacturer claims during this time.\n\nIn 2025, September proved once again to be the busiest launch month for smartwatches\u2014and we were only just about recovering from an unusually busy August.\n\nAhead of reviews being posted next month, we have all the new releases at Wareable HQ for extensive testing. Below are the just-announced devices currently in consideration on this list:\n\nWhile the watches we\u2019ve detailed in our recommendations are the best we\u2019ve tested, that doesn\u2019t mean they will remain so for long. As we mentioned earlier, it always pays to keep an eye on the latest releases.\n\nIn 2025, we\u2019ve seen a bumper amount of smartwatch launches; all the biggest names have delivered significant overhauls of their smartwatch lines. We\u2019ve seen multiple new releases from Apple, Garmin, Huawei, and Samsung, while the likes of Google, Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Amazfit have also delivered annual refreshes.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick list of every significant smartwatch launched this year.\n\nNote:  The  Apple Watch Series 11  is now official, with the 2025 update featuring enhanced battery life estimates, a slightly refined design, and support for Hypertension Notifications and a native sleep score. We\u2019re still testing the new flagship watch, which is why it hasn\u2019t yet taken top spot in our ranking. In the meantime, you can read  our comparison of the Series 11 and Series 10 .\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 is an outstanding smartwatch across the board, although it remains an option exclusive to iPhone users.\n\nIt\u2019s a more substantial update than in the couple of generations prior, with Apple delivering a pair of thinner and lighter smartwatches in new 42mm and 46mm sizes. These models also boast larger, more edge-to-edge displays that are brighter than ever, especially when viewed at an angle.\n\nAluminum remains the standard case material, but the premium option has been upgraded from stainless steel to carbon-neutral titanium (similar to the Apple Watch Ultra 2), a change we feel is a definite improvement. Other minor changes include an upgraded speaker that supports out-loud audio for more than just phone calls, a depth gauge, a water temperature sensor, the rebadged S10 chip, and slightly quicker charging.\n\nThese welcome additions build on the powerful features established in previous generations, including  Double Tap gestures ,  Low Power Mode ,  ECG readings  for health screening, a temperature sensor for detailed cycle tracking, and a thriving third-party app store.\n\nEven though we\u2019re certain to recommend the Series 11 over the Series 0 once our testing is complete, it\u2019s worth pointing out that it remains a superb option. On account of the watchOS 26 update, which adds features like Hypertension Notification, Workout Buddy, and Sleep Score, it\u2019s still able to deliver the most comprehensive smartwatch experience on the market.\n\nStill, some key caveats remain. The single-day battery life remains the Achilles\u2019 heel of the Series models, posing a problem for heavy users. We\u2019re also not convinced the bump in overall size will be to everyone\u2019s taste, particularly for those with smaller wrists.\n\nNote:  The Pixel Watch 3 was added to this list in September 2023. However, with  Google announcing the Pixel Watch 4  in August 2025 (ahead of its 9 October release date), it\u2019s crucial to understand that this is an outgoing generation. Below, we\u2019ll leave our original entry intact until we\u2019ve finished our testing for the upcoming smartwatch.\n\nWith the addition of a new case size, Google\u2019s Pixel Watch 3 has propelled itself to the top of the Wear OS field. The all-new 45mm model not only opens the Pixel Watch line to more users but also delivers genuine multi-day battery life. In our testing, it consistently lasted over 48 hours with the always-on display enabled, and that can be stretched to three or four days with conservative settings.\n\nWhile this performance is on par with the Galaxy Watch (though not the OnePlus Watch 3), the intuitive Fitbit platform is the key separator. Upgrades to the experience include Cardio Load for deeper training insights, a helpful morning brief, and improved running data. In a welcome move, the Daily Readiness Score is now also available to all Pixel Watch generations without a Fitbit Premium subscription.\n\nAccuracy remains a strong point. The heart rate data is among the best we\u2019ve tested, and while the GPS lacks dual-frequency support, it\u2019s precise enough for most needs. The watch also includes comprehensive sleep and health vitals tracking, although we find the stress tracking feature to be a less impressive aspect of the Fitbit experience.\n\nOverall, the Pixel Watch 3 is a remarkably refined and well-rounded smartwatch. Although battery life on the 41mm model is still average, the 45mm version is now our top recommendation for Android users.\n\nAfter several incremental updates, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 feels like a significant step forward and is the company\u2019s most compelling smartwatch in years. The big story is the integration of Google Gemini, which, unlike its predecessors, finally delivers a genuinely helpful and intelligent AI assistant on the wrist that can handle complex queries with ease.\n\nAvailable in 40mm and 44mm sizes, the Watch 8 features the new \u2018cushion\u2019 case design from the Ultra model, offering a cleaner and more refined look. The Super AMOLED display is also brighter and sharper than ever before, while subtle UI improvements make the Wear OS software smoother and more intuitive to navigate day-to-day.\n\nIt retains Samsung\u2019s powerful health suite, including ECG and blood pressure monitoring (which still requires a Samsung phone). New additions like \u2018Vascular Load\u2019 offer valuable insights into sleep stress, but other \u2018Labs\u2019 features like the \u2018Antioxidant Index\u2019 feel half-baked. While GPS accuracy fell short of dedicated sports watches in our testing, we found heart rate tracking to be impressively accurate (even during intense exercise).\n\nUnfortunately, the Galaxy Watch 8 doesn\u2019t solve the line\u2019s biggest weakness: battery life. Or, at least that\u2019s true of the smaller version we tested. With that model, you can expect around a day and a half of use, which means daily charging is still necessary.\n\nDespite the battery limitations, the Watch 8 is a resounding success. The polished design, accurate heart rate sensor, and the game-changing utility of Google Gemini make it a top smartwatch for most people, especially if you own a Samsung phone.\n\nNote:  The Huawei Watch Fit 3 has been a consistent presence on this list of the best smartwatches for the past couple of years, offering a great budget option (which you can still purchase for $119/\u00a3119).\n\nHowever, in May 2025, it was replaced by the Fit 4 and Fit 4 Pro. As such, we don\u2019t recommend purchasing this last-gen model\u2014but we\u2019ll leave our original entry below until we\u2019ve completed our testing of the latest models.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a massive clone of the Apple Watch, but it gets so much right. It\u2019s incredibly thin and light to wear, making it truly unisex. There is a range of strap options, but we don\u2019t know why people would look beyond the nylon option, which we tried during our review time (above).\n\nThe Watch Fit 3 offers generally good health and sports tracking, providing a broad spectrum of metrics and accurate data, including heart rate and GPS distance. It passed all our tests and punches well above its price tag, running particularly well-handled.\n\nSleep tracking is also fairly solid. While we did find it wasn\u2019t the most sensitive to grace our testing lab, it\u2019s consistent and helpful enough to get value from. Again, it\u2019s excellent for this price.\n\nWhere it falls short of Apple and Wear OS is the lack of a robust ecosystem, especially for apps and payments. Yet, the tradeoff is much-improved battery life. If you want 14 days, you will need to forego features like the always-on display, but you should get a week even with all the bells and whistles turned on.\n\nNote:  The  Apple Watch Ultra 3  is now official, with the 2025 update featuring enhanced battery life estimates, satellite messaging, and a larger display area. We\u2019re still testing the new watch, but you can  read our comparison of the Ultra 3 and Ultra 2  in the meantime.\n\nWe loved the original Apple Watch Ultra, and the second-gen model that launched in 2023 made gentle refinements to the overall proposition. This iteration features a boost in screen brightness, a carbon-neutral design, and a chip that enables the Double Tap feature.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get an  Apple Watch Ultra 3  last year as expected, with that model now rumored to arrive in September 2025. At last year\u2019s event, we were limited to a new black case option and  sleep apnea detection  support via watchOS 11, so it\u2019s likely a substantial upgrade is inbound.\n\nStill, the 49mm Ultra 2 remains bold and aimed at weekend warriors who want a superior Apple Watch to the Series 10. It\u2019s tough and suitable for diving and watersports, and runners will love the accurate dual-frequency GPS, which excelled in  our city marathon testing .\n\nThe feature we love most is the 2-3 days of battery life, which eliminates the charging anxiety associated with other Apple Watch models. Returning to a Series device after spending time with the Ultra 2 is tough; this is the peak Apple Watch experience.\n\nThe native outdoor apps still require some refinement, with mapping, navigation, and performance analysis underdeveloped compared to the Garmin Venu X1 (below). However, you can always seek out  third-party Ultra apps  to help it realize its potential.\n\nWear OS lacked a genuinely rugged outdoor smartwatch until the release of the Galaxy Watch Ultra in 2024.\n\nSamsung\u2019s most premium smartwatch bears a striking resemblance to the Apple Watch Ultra to a comical degree, yet it remains unique for Android users. And that\u2019s still true in 2025, with the brand quietly releasing a slightly better  2025 edition of the Galaxy Watch Ultra  when it announced the Galaxy Watch 8 series back in July.\n\nThe 47mm case size feels huge and may be too large for smaller wrists, but it offers accurate dual-frequency GNSS, all the health tech bells and whistles, 100ATM water resistance, and some proper sports tracking features, such as (very fiddly) FTP, and the ability to chain together different workouts.\n\nBattery life is between two and three days, but we did find the drain inexplicably inconsistent at launch, so it\u2019s hard to get a feel for how much you\u2019ll get.\n\nProviding you can handle the size, slightly clunky navigation, and inconsistent battery life, this is an excellent upgrade from the typical Samsung smartwatch experience.\n\nThe Garmin Venu X1 is a statement piece; a powerful sports watch wrapped in the best-looking, most comfortable smartwatch the company has ever produced. At just 7.9mm thick, the ultra-thin titanium case is a marvel of smartwatch engineering, making it a joy to wear 24/7.\n\nDespite its slim profile, it\u2019s a Garmin through and through. It packs the brand\u2019s full suite of advanced training metrics, including Training Status, Running Tolerance, and Endurance Score, as well as Garmin\u2019s excellent native mapping and coaching platform. We also found its core GPS and heart rate accuracy to be outstanding during testing. Plus, it even squeezes in Garmin\u2019s brilliantly useful LED flashlight.\n\nHowever, this aesthetic focus comes with significant compromises. The Venu X1\u2019s biggest flaw is its deeply un-Garmin-like battery life, managing just two days with the always-on display enabled. At its premium price tag, the absence of top-tier features (like Multi-Band GPS and an ECG sensor) also feels like a significant sacrifice.\n\nWhile it has basics like offline Spotify and call support, it isn\u2019t a true smartwatch rival to Apple or Samsung. The Venu X1 is for a specific user: the dedicated Garmin fan who has long craved a more elegant design and is willing to trade battery life and key features to get it.\n\nOver the past few months, we\u2019ve considered dropping the Apple Watch SE 2 from our smartwatch recommendations list. It\u2019s over two years old, and options such as the Huawei Watch Fit 4 are genuine alternatives at a fraction of the price.\n\nBut, as  we wrote after re-testing the SE 2 in November 2024 , it\u2019s still a fantastic sports-tracking smartwatch capable of running the latest watchOS software and remains zippy thanks to the S8 chip.\n\nFirst-timers looking for an introduction to the Apple Watch get all the essentials with this device: core fitness and wellness monitoring, accurate workout HR and GPS, a bustling App Store, Apple Pay, and even Fall Detection.\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with the SE if you\u2019re in the Apple ecosystem and want a solid starter smartwatch. The design is now dated, though. The thick border around the display ensures it feels significantly boxier than the Series 7-10 devices, and there\u2019s also no always-on display or ECG.\n\nThe final caveat, as we\u2019ve hinted throughout, is that we\u2019re also expecting it to be replaced by a newer model in September 2025. So, if you have it on your shortlist, find a good deal.\n\nA watch\u2019s fit, comfort, and wearability are primarily down to case size \u2013 and a few millimeters can make a huge difference. Those with small wrists should look in the 38-42mm range, while those who like chunky, oversized watches or have big wrists should look at anything above 45mm.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to consider the smartphone you use. Apple Watch is iOS only, and Wear OS watches, such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch lineup and Pixel Watch 3, are exclusive to Android.\n\nOlder Wear watches are compatible with both, but the iOS experience is diminished, and it\u2019s not recommended.\n\nHuawei, Fitbit, and Garmin smartwatches are compatible with both, but some advanced calling features from the wrist are usually exclusive to Android.\n\nCheck out our guides to the  best smartwatches for iPhone  and the  top Android watches  for more information.\n\nBuying into Apple Watch and Wear OS watches means you can access bustling app stores full of options from big-name brands, such as Spotify or Strava, and expand on the core features.\n\nFor example, platforms run by Garmin, Amazfit, and Huawei don\u2019t have the developer support for many quality apps. This means you\u2019re limited to basic functionality.\n\nSmartwatches are increasingly becoming health and fitness tools, so make sure yours has the sensors you want.\n\nNowadays, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a smartwatch without a heart rate sensor, and most are adept at 24/7 HR and resting heart rate.\n\nHowever, brands like Apple, Google Fitbit, and Samsung now include ECG, a powerful health tool. If you\u2019re curious,  read our ECG explainer .\n\nRunners will want an accurate GPS on board to track outdoor workouts.\n\nThe Apple Watch and Wear OS smartwatches generally only last a day or two away from the charger, which is one of the biggest turn-offs for people. There have been moves to extend that to 2-3 days, with the Apple Watch Ultra 2, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, and TicWatch Pro 5.\n\nLuckily, other smartwatches now last more than a week, with Fitbit, Huawei, Amazfit, and Garmin all pushing longer runtimes.\n\nA key consideration is whether you want your smartwatch to work away from your phone.\n\nMany manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, offer LTE versions, which require a separate data plan for purchase. Most carriers and networks have plans for LTE smartwatches.\n\nIf you find this feature important, check out our  guide to the best LTE smartwatches .\n\nConor joined Wareable in 2017, quickly making a name for himself by testing out language translation earbuds on a first date, navigating London streets in a wearable airbag, and experiencing skydiving in a VR headset.
