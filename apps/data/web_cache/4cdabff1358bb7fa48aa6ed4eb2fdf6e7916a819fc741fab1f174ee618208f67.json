But finding the perfect pair isn\u2019t as simple as you might think. Sure, your best friend may love Hokas, but that\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll benefit from them, too. With factors like cushioning, stability, and traction to think about, the search for the right shoe can quickly become overwhelming. Yet proper footwear will help you enjoy the  benefits of running  long-term.\n\n\u201cInvesting in the right running shoes tailored to your specific needs can help you enjoy the sport for many years to come, allowing you to maintain an active lifestyle and minimize the risk of injury,\u201d says\u00a0 Suzanne Fuchs, DPM , a podiatrist at LuxePodiatry in Jupiter, Florida. \u201cProper footwear can help prevent injuries such as  plantar fasciitis , Achilles tendonitis, and stress fractures, which can occur if your shoes do not provide adequate support, cushioning, or fit.\u201d\n\nAs a dedicated runner and experienced fitness reviewer, I\u2019ve personally tried dozens of pairs of running shoes over the years. I bring this experience, alongside insights from Dr. Fuchs, to bring you the best running shoes for a variety of needs, foot types, and gait types. Some of these picks I tested myself, but all of them were vetted with Fuchs\u2019 help. Here are my top picks.\n\nIf you\u2019re a lady looking for an uber-comfy shoe to  cruise around in , Brook\u2019s Ghost Max is an excellent choice. True to its name, it has \u201cmax\u201d level cushioning to reduce impact and make for an extremely enjoyable run \u2014 some even compare it to walking on clouds. We especially like that it\u2019s versatile enough to be worn both for exercise or long days on your feet.\n\nIts neutral, 6 millimeter (mm) drop level (the difference in height between the heel and forefoot) makes it a Goldilocks shoe that appeals to people with a variety of preferences. The plush midsole reduces shock as well as heel, ankle, knee, and lower back pain. The shoe also helps runners stay stable over terrains like slippery cobblestone streets. Just note that as a maximalist shoe, it\u2019s on the clunkier side and isn\u2019t built for running speed or performance.\n\nThe Hoka Challenger 7 can take you from trail to track, rain or shine. It has grippy soles to keep you stable over a variety of terrains, and the Gore-Tex version is weatherproofed, so you have no excuses not to run on rainy days. Being in sunny coastal California, I tested the non-Gore-Tex version, which kept me safe over dewy grass, rocks, and mud. The plush midsole protected my feet from cold concrete, and the cushioning gave the shoes a bit of bounce, making them quite comfortable.\n\nDespite this extra cushioning, the shoe was still lightweight enough to make my runs feel almost effortless. The breathable mesh upper makes the shoe a great choice for warmer weather, but with a pair of warm wool socks, I was prepared for colder days. I will say that the sizing felt slightly off \u2014 they were big enough for my heel to slip a bit, but any smaller size would have probably been too snug. Also, I was disappointed that the sneakers lacked reflective components. Since the style is meant for all conditions, seeing some reflective details to enhance visibility would have been nice.\n\nReady to hit the trail in 2025? This shoe is designed for rugged terrain and features a wide toe box, which allows toes to splay naturally for better stability and comfort on uneven trails. I tested these shoes on a variety of landscapes, from flat to rocky, and found they provided outstanding grip and traction. They\u2019re also cushioned and comfy, without sacrificing ground feel, so I could still feel and navigate the earth beneath me.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that as a zero-drop shoe, the heel and forefoot are at the same level. This style encourages a more natural foot strike by mimicking how our feet naturally rest when barefoot. According to Fuchs, zero-drop shoes can strengthen the feet and encourage a more natural foot position, but they may not provide enough support for everyone. If you\u2019re used to a higher drop, make sure to work down to a zero-drop shoe gradually. Since there\u2019s less cushioning, I find this shoe style wonderful for running on a trail but not cushioned enough for the pavement.\n\nAccording to Fuchs, people with high arches should seek out both cushioning and flexibility, as these features absorb shock and relieve pressure on the arches. This New Balance pair has an ample foam midsole for a plush and protected ride, plus the shoes still bend naturally to the foot's movement.\n\nThe shoe's upper part is flexible and breathable yet keeps feet nice and secure. Between the dynamic yet cushioned midsole and the protective mesh upper shoe, this sneaker is ideally suited to those with high arches. Other bonuses include reflective details to keep you protected in low visibility and great traction that can take you over a variety of terrains. Although, if you plan on racing in these kicks, you might want to reconsider \u2014 they\u2019re a bit too bulky for that.\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nBeing flat-footed myself, I tested the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 23 over a variety of terrains and found its GuideRails support system \u2014 which is designed to gently align your feet, knees, and hips \u2014 was effective at keeping my feet in a neutral position. The plush midsole made for a comfortable and springy ride, and the arch support kept my feet feeling stable. Also, thanks to an unfortunate injury over a decade ago, I have a bit of sensitivity in my left knee, but the cushioning kept me feeling protected. All of that said, the shoe\u2019s support system could feel a little rigid for some, and they\u2019re a bit clunky.\n\nWell-cushioned shoes with proper support can help minimize impact for people with  knee pain  or  back pain , says Fuchs. The Cloudeclipse offers both. Its signature CloudTec cushioning is made to adapt to your body, absorbing strain and reducing impact for a safer and more comfortable run. The shoe also contains Helion superfoam, which has both soft and stiff elements, providing the ideal combination of support and cushioning. The shoe stands out for its great traction, making it an excellent choice for running in wet conditions. However, these sneakers are a bit too clunky and big to be used for racing (where lightweight, minimalist shoes usually perform best).\n\nIf you struggle with heel pain, known as  plantar fasciitis , shoes with excellent cushioning, particularly in the heel, and arch support are essential, says Fuchs. The Brooks Glycerin GTS offers both. Much like other Brooks styles, it has a reputation among runners for exceptional cushioning that relieves fatigue and the effects of plantar fasciitis, plus innersoles that mold to your feet and offer relief from any post-run arch pain.\n\nThe shoes\u2019 springy cushion may help relieve joint and muscle pain. Plus, the shoe has Brooks\u2019 signature GuideRails system, designed to keep your foot in a stable neutral position. While we are big fans of the GuideRails system, the feature might feel restrictive to some. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that these sneakers are on the heavier side.\n\n[ 2 ]\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the shoe has exceptional cushioning \u2014 I tested it from trail to pavement and found it was one of the most comfortable shoes I\u2019ve ever tried. I know I\u2019ll be reaching for these sneakers again and again, but our research has found that their firm cushioning might not be great for people with other gait types.\n\nI started running at 9 years old and have included it as a part of my fitness regimen ever since. I currently log between 5 to 25 miles per week, depending on the season.\n\nTo bring you the best running shoes, I consulted with Suzanne Fuchs, DPM, a podiatrist at Luxe Podiatry in Jupiter, Florida. I also vetted dozens of products from a wide range of athletic companies with an excellent reputation and innovative features. Then, I tested several pairs over a period of weeks in a variety of terrains (pavement, trails, and beaches). I evaluated them all for fit, functionality, comfortability, durability, quality, and style. For those that I could not test, I carefully researched the shoe\u2019s features and found expert opinions.\n\nThe right shoe is designed for your foot type, gait type, the terrain you\u2019ll be covering, and your preferences. Assess the following factors:\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of understanding your specific foot and gait type, says Fuchs. The right shoe is designed for your foot type, gait type, the terrain you\u2019ll be covering, and your preferences.\n\n\u201cIt's crucial to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to running shoes,\u201c says Fuchs. \u201cEach individual has unique foot anatomy, biomechanics, and running styles, which means that what works for one person may not be suitable for another.\u201d\n\nTo get a clear picture of your needs, consider consulting with a podiatrist or get your feet  tested for free at a running store like Fleet Feet .\n\nIn general though, when you\u2019re buying a shoe, consider its cushioning level, firmness level, stability features, how well you can feel the ground when you wear it, how much bounce the shoe has, its stack height and drop level, its weatherproofing components (if you live in an area with rain or snow), its traction components, and its breathability\n\nMost of all, make sure you\u2019re considering what type of running you\u2019ll do and in what conditions. Winter jogs may call for weatherproofed shoes with great traction to keep you stable over slippery ground. Certain shoes are designed for running on trails alone, while others are best for concrete, and some can handle any terrain. If you\u2019re primarily a jogger trying to get your steps in, a high-comfort shoe should be a priority, while racers looking for performance shoes may find additional cushioning too cumbersome and bulky to maintain speed.\n\nWearing improper shoes over time can lead to cumulative wear and tear on your body, saysFuchs. The strain on your musculoskeletal system can result in  chronic pain  or injuries that may not only sideline you from running but could also affect your overall mobility and quality of life in the long run.\n\n\u201cProper footwear can help prevent injuries such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, and stress fractures, which can occur if your shoes do not provide adequate support, cushioning, or fit,\u201d says Fuchs. \u201cIf you regularly run without the proper footwear, you might find yourself dealing with these issues much sooner, potentially reducing your running career by several years.\u201d\n\nAccording to\u00a0 research , you should replace running shoes every 300 to 500 miles, depending on factors like running style, body weight, and the surfaces you run on.\n\nBrittany Elyse Vargas has been a professional writer and journalist for over a decade and has been exploring topics around mental health, mind-body medicine, health, wellness, and psycho-spiritual development for the past 20 years.\n\nAs a trauma-informed health journalist, she is a regular contributor to Everyday Health, Medscape and Verywell Mind.
