Some of the best laptops under $1,000 have fast processors, beautiful displays, impressive portability and lengthy battery life\u2014just not always all at once. The absolute best laptop under $1,000 at this time is the  Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 , with its incredible blend of performance and efficiency, in a lightweight design.\n\nThe  Apple MacBook Air M2  is a great alternative for Apple fans, while gamers should consider the  Acer Nitro V . Whatever your laptop needs are, you can find an awesome one under $1,000. Here are some of the best, picked by a tech expert.\n\nCPU:  Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus |  RAM:  16GB LPDDR5X |  Graphics:  Qualcomm Adreno |  Storage:  256GB |  Display:  13.8-inch |  Resolution:  2304 x 1536 |  Refresh rate:  120Hz |\u00a0 Battery:  Up to 20 hours |  Weight:  2.96 pounds\n\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 is a contender for one of the best laptops you can buy at any price, so the fact that you can get the base model for under $1,000 is a real treat. Even at this price, it comes with the amazing Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor, with 10 cores that are ultra fast, and ultra efficient. This laptop performs on par with much more expensive hardware, and does so while giving you class-leading battery life of up to 20 hours between charges. It\u2019s a little light on storage, but you can always pay a bit more for extra, or add an external SSD somewhere down the line.\n\nThe 13.8-inch LCD display is gorgeous, with impressive contrast for a non-OLED, and super rich and vibrant colors. It\u2019s bright, too, so works well on sunny days, and with its slim bezels and lightweight design, you can take it with you wherever you go. With a 120Hz refresh rate, mouse movements look super smooth, and casual gaming is extra fluid.\n\nCPU:  Apple M2 with 8-core CPU |  RAM:  8GB LPDDR5 |  Graphics:  Apple M2 GPU |  Storage:  256GB |  Display:  13.6-inch |  Resolution:  2560 x 1664 |  Refresh rate:  60Hz |  Battery:  Up to 18 hours |  Weight:  2.7 pounds\n\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\nDespite the MacBook Air M2 not being Apple\u2019s latest Air model, it doesn\u2019t miss a beat when it comes to modern performance or features. This laptop features Apple\u2019s M2 processor that offers incredible performance and efficiency. It\u2019s only a couple of steps behind the latest M3 models and sips power so lightly that you get a near 20-hour battery life. The storage and memory are limited on this model, and unfortunately the storage is slow (so if you can buy  the 512GB model , we\u2019d recommend it) but it\u2019s still plenty fast for everyday web browsing, online streaming, office work, and playing casual games.\n\nLike all MacBook Airs, this model is super light at just 2.7 pounds, making it easy to use it on your lap or carry it during your commute. The built-in 1080p webcam looks great, and you get support for Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5. It comes with just two USB Type-C ports for Thunderbolt 4/USB connections and a 3.5 mm headphone jack, so invest in a dock or adapter if you want to connect lots of accessories.\n\nCPU:  Intel Core Ultra 5 Series 1 |  RAM:  8GB LPDDR5 |  Graphics:  Intel |  Storage:  256GB |  Display:  14-inch |  Resolution:  1920 x 1200 |  Refresh rate:  60Hz |  Battery:  Up to 10 hours |  Weight:  3.2 pounds\n\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\nAcer\u2019s Chromebook Plus Spin 714 packs a lot of power into its Chromebook form factor, delivering incredible performance in local or online apps and services, whether you\u2019re using it as a laptop or flipping it into tablet mode. Along with a modern Intel CPU with 10 cores for high-performance multitasking, you also get 8GB of fast memory and, crucially, 256GB of SSD storage, which is a real rarity in a Chromebook. You can augment this with 100GB of free online cloud storage, or with an external drive down the line, if needed.\n\nThe 1080p display is bright and crisp at 14-inches, and helps keep the battery life at its mid-tier 10-hour rating. The dedicated neural processor in this device also helps enhance new AI generative tasks at the local level, and you can leverage Google\u2019s own Gemini in all of Google\u2019s online services.\n\nCPU:  Intel Core i7-13620H |  RAM:  16GB DDR5 |  Graphics:  Nvidia RTX 4060 |  Storage:  512GB |  Display:  15.6-inch |  Resolution:  1920 x 1080 |  Refresh rate:  144Hz |  Battery:  Up to 8 hours |  Weight:  4.7 pounds\n\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\nThe Acer Nitro V15 might technically break our $1,000 limit, but it\u2019s on sale and well below it for now. It\u2019s worth it either way, though, as you not only get a powerful CPU, but a great GPU too. Whereas most laptops at this price are limited to the entry-level RTX 4050, this gaming laptop comes with the much-more-capable RTX 4060, with many more CUDA cores and a lot more power. Together they drive high frame rates in any game you want, with the 1080 full HD display making games look crisp and clear at 15.6 inches.\n\nWith a high refresh rate you can enjoy buttery smooth frame rates, and with the RTX 4060 supporting Nvidia\u2019s Tensor cores and DLSS technology, you can boost frame rates even more with upscaling and frame generation. The battery life is the only real downside to this laptop\u2014though it\u2019s rated for eight hours, that\u2019s unlikely to be viable in the real world. Expect an hour or two of gaming away from a power socket, and something closer to five for general use, if reviewers are to be believed.\n\nCPU:  Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus |\u00a0 RAM:  16GB LPDDR5X |\u00a0 Graphics:  Qualcomm Adreno |  Storage:  256GB SSD |  Display:\u00a0 13-inch touch screen |  Resolution: \u00a02880 x 1920 |  Refresh rate:  120Hz |  Battery:  Up to 14 hours |  Weight:  2 pounds\n\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 11 is a stellar laptop for a range of uses, thanks to its detachable keyboard design that makes it both a super lightweight laptop and an incredibly lightweight tablet. The keyboard can be used wirelessly and is very comfortable to type on\u2014the only downside is that  it\u2019s sold separately . If the modern  Flex keyboard  design is too expensive, though, you can also use older Surface Pro keyboards. They\u2019re all compatible.\n\nThe Snapdragon X Plus processor offers incredible power for the money, with 10 cores that give you excellent multi-tasking capabilities or the raw power to run demanding applications. The gaming performance isn\u2019t stellar, but the onboard GPU is good enough for casual and esports gaming. The LCD is bright and bold with vibrant colors, and you can upgrade to  an OLED model  if you want an even more impressive display\u2014though that does come at a higher price.\n\nCPU: \u00a0AMD Ryzen 8840HS |\u00a0 RAM:  16GB LPDDR5X |\u00a0 Graphics:  AMD Radeon |  Storage:  1TB |  Display:\u00a0 14-inch touch screen |  Resolution:  1900 x 1200 |  Refresh rate:  60Hz |  Battery:  Up to 12.5 hours |  Weight:  3.6 pounds\n\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\nYou can get a whole lot of 2-in-1 laptop at around $1,000, but you don\u2019t have to spend that much if you don\u2019t want to. The Yoga 7 from Lenovo is well under our maximum price, and yet it offers some seriously powerful hardware. The Ryzen 8840HS has eight Zen 4 cores running at over 5GHz, making this a laptop that would outshine high-end desktops from just a few years ago. That\u2019s paired up with 16GB of super fast memory, and with a terabyte of storage, you can fit all your files, folders, games, apps and photos with space to spare.\n\nThe display isn\u2019t the brightest, and it is only full HD, but it\u2019s still crisp and clear and very responsive to both touch and stylus inputs. Battery life is solid, at around 12 hours of mixed use, and the overall build quality is strong. It\u2019s a little heavy, so you won\u2019t want to one-hand the tablet mode for long, but you do get good connections, with both USB-A and USB-C ports, as well as headphone jack and both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2.\n\nThe Forbes Vetted team has published hundreds of  tech and electronic guides , including  home office essentials  like the  best home printers  and  Wi-Fi extenders .\n\nTo find the very best laptops under $1,000, we leaned on our own expertise and consumer reviews while looking at bestselling models from top brands and comparing key features.\n\nThe processor, or CPU, of a laptop has a big impact on its overall performance. If you\u2019re buying a Chromebook, you can get away with a low-end Intel or AMD CPU (or even one of the SoCs from Mediatek), while Apple machines are much better off with Apple\u2019s own silicon, like the M1 or M2 processors.\n\nFor Windows laptops, you want an Intel Core Ultra 1 or 2 generation CPU, or an AMD Ryzen 7000 or Ryzen 8000 processor. Don\u2019t buy anything with less than four cores, and if you want to do anything demanding, it needs to be Ryzen 5 or Intel Core Ultra 5 or better.\n\nYou can get by with onboard graphics if you\u2019re not going to be playing any games. But if you are gaming, you need a dedicated graphics chip\u2014ideally one from a recent generation, like Nvidia RTX 3000 or 4000, or AMD RX 6000 or 7000. Entry-level options like Nvidia\u2019s MX550 and AMD's RX 680M are perfectly viable for esports play, too.\n\nFor even basic use, 8GB of RAM should be the minimum. If you want to play games or do anything beyond basic office work, then 16GB makes a big difference in how functional your laptop feels. If you\u2019re looking to do video editing, consider 32GB the minimum and anything more is a bonus.\n\nMost laptops need at least 256GB of SSD space to be basically functional, but Chromebooks can get away with 128GB or even less since they come with 100GB of free online storage. However, if you\u2019re a gamer or want to store anything beyond a few photos and videos, select at least half a terabyte or more. Big game library? Opt for 1 TB at least.\n\nDisplays not only impact how good your laptop looks, but how big and heavy it is, too. If you value portability, smaller 13-inch screens are great, and 1080p looks stellar, too. No need for anything higher.\n\nFor more screen space for gaming or work, then 15 inches looks a lot better, and you can go for higher resolutions like 2K to get a crisper picture. The big 17-inch displays should only be considered if you want a desktop replacement laptop and need maximum screen real estate.\n\nIf you want the ultimate experience, try to get a laptop with an OLED display. Those are rare under $1,000, but it makes your movies, games, and even work documents look far richer.\n\nThe average battery life for most laptops under $1,000 is around 10 hours. If you can get more than that, great, but don\u2019t expect more than a few hours out of gaming laptops. The best battery life in laptops at this price point are with Apple machines and the new Surface devices from Microsoft with Qualcomm processors. They can reach up to 20 hours and beyond in some cases.\n\nWe updated all of our recommendations to reflect current and new models.
