Here\u2019s how it works .\n\nIf you're deciding between the iPhone 16 vs iPhone 16 Pro, it's worth remembering that the entry-level model has picked up a lot of formerly Pro-exclusive features. This year the cheaper iPhone has a customizable  Action button ,  Apple Intelligence , plus new upgrades like a 48MP camera,  Camera Control  button and the powerful A18 chipset.\n\nBut the iPhone 16 Pro series obviously has a bunch of extra benefits. The screens are now even bigger, and the  5x tetraprism lens  is now available on iPhone 16 Pro. Plus, there's the adaptive ProMotion display, larger batteries and upgraded 48MP ultrawide camera. So which model is the  best iPhone  for you?\n\nHere's our full breakdown and don't forget to check our  iPhone 16 review  and  iPhone 16 Pro review  for a more in-depth assessment of each device.\n\nThe major similarity between all four iPhone models is the new Camera Control button, which lives on the bottom left-hand side of the phone, and the fact they all run  Apple Intelligence . All of the new iPhone 16 devices will also offer  Visual Intelligence , which is  currently available in the iOS 18.2 beta  but is confirmed to launch to everyone  sometime in December.  This new AI vision mode allows you to look up real-time information on what the camera sees and act on it.\n\nThe  Camera Control  is a multi-purpose haptic button that also ties into Visual Intelligence if you want it to. The primary function of the button is to open the camera app quickly, and better control what happens without having to rely on the usual touchscreen controls.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to it than that. A light tap on the Camera Control will launch a minimalistic, distraction free camera interface, with the option to slide over the button to control features like camera zoom. A second light tap opens up a small menu, which you can navigate through options like aperture, depth and camera styles.\n\nThe Action button may have debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro series but it\u2019s made the jump to non-Pro phones this year. Meaning iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro owners alike will be able to customize the button to do one of a number of actions or shortcuts.\n\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\n\nThe Audio Mix feature for videos is available across all four new iPhones. With it, you can tweak the sound in your clips so that you can focus on the voices in frame, make it sound like a studio recording or mix in some ambient noise.\n\nOther iPhone 16 features previously exclusive to Pro models also include the ability to capture spatial photos and video with the new camera layout, hardware accelerated ray-tracing from the new A18 chipset, and the ability to play AAA game titles on the go.  Wi-Fi 7  connectivity is also available on all four models, though that\u2019s completely new for 2024.\n\nVisual Intelligence is an AI camera mode which links Apple Intelligence to the camera and lets you scan and analyze the world around you. Think of it as a kind of AI Vision, which we\u2019ve seen from various AI chatbots, or  Google Lens . Visual Intelligence is able to scan text, identify animals or objects, translate text, search  Google  or get  ChatGPT  to help you out and so much more. All using a mix of on-device and cloud-based computing.\n\nNaturally every  every other Apple Intelligence feature  we\u2019ve heard about so far are available on all iPhone 16 models \u2014 alongside the  iPhone 15 Pro  and  iPhone 15 Pro Max . That means all iPhone 16 owners will be able to enjoy features like Image Playground\u2019s image generation, custom genmoji, AI-enhanced search in Apple Photos, the  enhanced version of Siri , AI mail and notification summaries and more.\n\nThe same goes for  all the new features available in iOS 18 , including satellite messaging, customizable home screens, locked apps and Hidden Folder,  iPhone Mirroring on Macs , RCS messaging and more.\n\nThere are a significant number of iPhone 16 vs iPhone 16 Pro differences you need to know. Normally the standard and Pro iPhones some in the same size configurations \u2014 but that\u2019s no longer the case. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus still have the same 6.1- and 6.7-inch displays as ever, but the Pro and Pro Max have grown to a respective 6.3 and 6.9 inches.\n\nThis also means the the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the largest iPhone Apple has ever made and that could be appealing for those of you that like large screen phones \u2014 or a complete turn off for those who don't.\n\nSadly, beyond this screen upgrade on Pro models, the rest of the display has stayed exactly the same on all four new iPhones. That means the standard models don\u2019t have the ProMotion upgrade people have been pestering Apple for for years, and are stuck with a 60Hz display instead of a 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n\nLikewise, the titanium shell is also an iPhone 16 Pro exclusive, complete with a new internal thermal management system that's aided by a new graphite-clad aluminum substructure. Considering the  iPhone 15 Pro did have some issues with overheating , and the fact the A18 Pro is likely to be a very hard worker, the more heat Apple can dissipate the better.\n\nThe A18 Pro may have a similar name to the iPhone 16\u2019s A18 chipset, but the Pro chip is an upgrade in itself. While Apple hasn\u2019t said how much more powerful the chip is compared to the standard A18, it is supposed to be 15% faster and 20% more efficient than the A17 Pro with 2x faster ray tracing and video encoding to boot.\n\niPhone 16 benchmarking scores  can give us an idea of how much more powerful the Pro model is. While we shouldn't take these scores as gospel, we can see that there's a noticeable boost in performance power with the iPhone 16 Pro \u2014 especially on multi-core testing. But the iPhone 16 still outperforms the  best Android phones  in those same categories, which is worth keeping in mind.\n\nAccording to Apple, a lot of the focus is on Apple Intelligence and on-device AI, but the speed of the chip will be beneficial for other things \u2014 especially in the camera department. According to Apple it will help power the new 4K 120fps  Dolby Vision  video recording capabilities \u2014 and a zero-lag camera shutter.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro has an upgraded camera, including the debut of the tetraprism telephoto lens on the iPhone 16 Pro \u2014 complete with 5x optical magnification. While the tetraprism hasn\u2019t changed on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, both Pro phones have had some major improvements on the other two rear camera lenses. The most obvious is the ultrawide now offers 48MP resolution, compared to 12MP on iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nThat lens, and the 48MP main camera lens, also have larger quad-pixel sensors. This new sensor also helps with shutter lag, while promising 2x faster performance and auto-focus. Larger sensors generally allow more light to be captured as well, offering better picture quality and low light performance.\n\nNaturally, the Pro models are the  only iPhones to offer USB 3 charging and data transfer speeds , while the iPhone 16 is limited to the same USB 2.0-speeds you\u2019d get back when Lightning cables were still a thing. Both phones also offer larger batteries, with iPhone 16 coming in 6.3% larger than iPhone 15, and iPhone 16 Pro growing by 9.4%.\n\nOur  iPhone 16 battery life testing  also showed a significant improvement on both phones, aided by the larger batteries and A18's improvements to energy efficiency. iPhone 16 Pro is particularly noteworthy because it clocked in at 14 hours and 7 minutes, which is over 3 hours longer than the iPhone 15 Pro. iPhone 16 was no slouch either, having lasted 12 hours 43 minutes \u2014 an improvement of over 90 minutes compared to last year.\n\nThere are times when it pays off to go the cheaper route, and the iPhone 16 might be one of those times. While there is a very clear boundary between the standard and Pro models, the various upgrades offered this year mean that the iPhone 16 is closer to being a Pro model than ever before.\n\nOf course, various things are still missing from the regular iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, like the tetraprism telephoto lens, adaptive ProMotion display, the higher performance A18 Pro chipset and the new 48MP ultrawide camera and audio upgrades. There\u2019s no doubt that those are all great things, but the question is whether they\u2019re worth an extra $200+ dollars to get hold of now.\n\nSaving that money might be worthwhile, and it could be enough to get you a storage upgrade or some useful accessories \u2014 like a case, the  AirPods 4 , or part of an  Apple Watch Series 10 . It all depends on just how much you care about the iPhone 16 Pr's larger displays and extra camera and performance features.\n\nTom is the Tom's Guide's UK Phones Editor, tackling the latest smartphone news and vocally expressing his opinions about upcoming features or changes.
