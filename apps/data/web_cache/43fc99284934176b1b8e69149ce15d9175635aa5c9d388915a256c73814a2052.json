Here\u2019s how it works .\n\nI've been testing and reviewing phones for nearly two decades now, and in that time, I've never seen stiffer competition among the best phones. And the number of contenders only figure to grow now that we're in the heart of New Phone season.\n\n1.  iPhone 17 Pro Max : Best overall 2.  Galaxy S25 Ultra : Best camera phone 3.  Pixel 9a : Best under $500 4.  Pixel 10 Pro : Smartest phone 5.  OnePlus 13 : Best Android flagship value 6.  Pixel 10 : Zoom photography for less 7.  Nothing Phone 3a Pro : Best alternative value 8.  iPhone 17 : best iPhone value 9.  Galaxy Z Flip 7 : Best foldable 10.  Galaxy S25 Edge : Best thin phone\n\nThat's the time of year when phone makers roll out their latest models just ahead of the holiday shopping season. Samsung got the ball rolling with its new foldable phones \u2014 with the  Galaxy Z Flip 7  even landing on this list \u2014 proceeded afterwards by  Google 's  Pixel 10  phones and subsequently Apple's new  iPhone 17  devices.\n\nIf you need a phone now, I've turned to the rest of the phone reviews team at Tom's Guide to put together this list of 10 top devices that tick all the boxes for performance, camera features and battery life. Now that Apple released its new devices, the  iPhone 17 Pro Max  takes the crown away from the  Galaxy S25 Ultra .\n\nApple gives the iPhone 17 Pro Max its biggest hardware and software makeovers, with attractive looking two-toned design and  iOS 26  update. The base model in the lineup, the iPhone 17, also gets its biggest upgrades in years with a 120Hz refresh rate and double the storage capacity.\n\nSamsung's reign at the top spot has been impressive given it has remained there for since the beginning of the year. But you can't go wrong with any of the new Galaxy S25 models, but the S25 Ultra is the best of the bunch by far. It's the longest-lasting Samsung phone we've tested, with a big, bright screen and an impressive bath of Galaxy AI features, some of which are exclusive to Samsung's latest flagships.\n\nOf course, those Galaxy AI features are available on  all  of the S25 models, which is why you're not missing a step should you opt for the cheaper  Samsung Galaxy S25 . You'll also find great AI capabilities on both the  Galaxy S25 Edge  and the Galaxy Z Flip 7, two phones with their own unique designs.\n\nIf you're reluctant to pay $1,000 or more for a phone \u2014 and I can't say I blame you \u2014 the  Pixel 9a  stands out for its sub-$500 cost. You also can beat the high-cost of smartphones by opting for the iPhone 17, which matches the Apple Intelligence features of the more expensive iPhone 17 Pro Max. Google's leans even more into AI with the  Pixel 10  and  Pixel 10 Pro , with the former setting the bar for all $799-priced phones.\n\nI've reviewed many of these phones first-hand, with other Tom's Guide phone experts adding their thoughts and insights for an in-depth look at which devices you should consider. Between every one of our phone reviewers, we've got nearly five decades of experience evaluating phones from every possible angle.\n\nOur best phone picks are based on our lab tests and real-world use of each phone we get our hands on. Here are the 10 phones you should consider if you're looking to get a new handset right now.\n\nBest Overall\n\nThe best iPhone comes with the best performance as well. If you're after that best in class experience, look no farther than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, which gets a physical makeover, upgraded telephoto camera, and obscenely long battery life.\n\nRead more below\n\nBest Cameras\n\nWhen it comes to giving you the most utility, you can't top the Galaxy S25 Ultra with its quadruple camera system, handwriting took with the S Pen, useful Galaxy AI features, and the desktop PC-like experience of Samsung DeX.\n\nRead more below\n\nBest Value\n\nWith a Tensor G4 chip offering most \u2014 though not all \u2014 of the AI features found on the Pixel 9 flagships, the Pixel 9a is a great low-cost flagship alternative. And its cameras perform much better than the ones on many more expensive devices.\n\nRead more below\n\nI'm the managing editor for mobile at Tom's Guide, where I've been working since 2015. In total, I've covered technology for 25 years now \u2014 I was even there when Steve Jobs showed off the original iPhone back in 2007. I've been looking at and testing phones since that day, and if you visit my Northern California home, you can marvel at the stacks of phones I keep handy for head-to-head testing.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max gives Apple the top spot top spot away from the Galaxy S25 Ultra to become the best phones we've tested, but that's more of a reflection of its upgrades and new redesign. Promised  Siri  improvements tapping into AI won't arrive until 2026, but there are some additional Apple Intelligence features included with the  iOS 26  release.\n\nJust like how Liquid Glass is a big makeover for the software, there's still plenty to love about the iPhone 16 Pro Max's hardware. This model offers a brand new, two-toned design that brings the biggest change to the series since the Pro Max's inception, an upgraded telephoto camera, faster processor, and new Center Stage front camera.\n\nYou won't have to ditch your iPhone 16 Pro Max if you upgraded in 2024, But owners of older iPhones will appreciate the boosts in performance, photo processing and smarter features that the iPhone 17 Pro Max brings to the table.\n\nPrice and value:  While this model commands the same $1,199 cost as its predecessor, its faster A19 Pro chip and bigger battery means you're getting more for your money. That's particularly true when the Ultra model of Samsung's Galaxy S flagships costs $100 more than Apple's top model.\n\n\"Less expensive\" is relative, though, as the iPhone 17 Pro Max's $1,199 starting price is a lot for some people to pay.\n\nCamera performance:  iPhones live and die by their cameras, and the telephoto lens on the iPhone 17 Pro Max offers some notable improvements. Apple ditches the 12MP 5x optical zoom camera of the iPhone 16 Pro Max and instead swaps its for a 48P telephoto with 4x optical that can achieve 'optical-quality' at 8x zoom. If that's not enough, it also packages in a new 18MP Center Stage camera that makes shooting selfies a lot more convenient.\n\nIf there's one area where the iPhone 17 Pro Max still proves untouchable, it has to be none other than low light performance. The photos it captures with night mode are brighter, sharper, and more detailed than all the other flagships.\n\nBattery and charging:  The battery on the iPhone 17 Pro Max lasts nearly 18 hours on our battery test, where we have a phone surf the web until its battery gives out. The average phone barely makes it past 10 hours, but the iPhone 17 Pro Max was just getting warmed up at that point. No other iPhone has ever lasted that long, with the  iPhone 16 Plus  coming the closest with an average result of around 16.5 hours.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Apple increases the wired charging speed of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to 35W.\n\nOverall performance:   Qualcomm 's Snapdragon 8 Elite is giving the iPhone all it can handle, but the A19 Pro chipset powering the iPhone 17 Pro Max turns out to be faster in some regard.\n\nWe noticed the extra oomph when using the iPhone 17 Pro Max to perform everyday tasks and switch between apps. When we used the iPhone 17 Pro Max to transcode a video, the task took half as long as it did on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And with a vapor chamber inside, the iPhone 17 Pro Max runs at top performance while remaining cool.\n\nVerdict:  The iPhone 17 Pro Max wins top marks for design, photography and performance. There's room for improvement with AI features, and it's very expensive relative to some of the other phones on this list, but you definitely get a lot of power and polish for your money.\n\nRead the full review:   iPhone 17 Pro Max\n\nAttributes\n\nNotes\n\nRating\n\nPrice\n\nThis is the most expensive iPhone Apple sells. You can save $100 with the iPhone 17 Pro, if you don't mind the smaller screen and less battery life.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nCameras\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is one of the best camera phones we've tested, though both the Pixel 10 Pro and Galaxy S25 Ultra beat it on zoomed shots.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nPower\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite-powered phones may have caught up to Apple's silicon, but the A19 Pro continues to be a top performer, particularly when it comes to overall speed and daily tasks.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBattery life\n\nYou won't need to charge your phone up during the day. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is the longest-lasting iPhone we've ever tested, finishing ahead of the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nWhy you can trust Tom's Guide\n \n \n \n \n Our writers and editors spend hours analyzing and reviewing products, services, and apps to help find what's best for you.  Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nDon't look for big hardware changes with the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to last year's model. instead, Samsung has put the focus on building out its Galaxy AI features to excellent effect. In fact, it's fair to say, that mobile AI gets to the next level with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nThat's because Samsung has added important features like cross app actions, where you can use the on-board digital assistant to interact with apps on your phone \u2014 both Samsung and Google apps, initially, along with Whatsapp and  Spotify . Even better, you can give one command that triggers multiple actions, like looking up the date of an event, adding it to your calendar and texting the info to a friend.\n\nA  Personal Data Engine  on board the phone learns your preferences, interests and activities and fills a new  Now Brief  screen with relevant information about upcoming appointments, weather forecasts or more. Now Brief felt pretty bare bones during our initial Galaxy S25 Ultra testing, but the promise is that it's going to learn more about you over time and adjust its recommendations accordingly. Now that the S25 Ultra's been out a few months, we'll circle back to see if the feature has come into its own.\n\nOther AI favorites like Circle to Search gain new powers and new features like the Now Bar serve as Samsung's version of Live Activities on the iPhone, helping you track ongoing notifications from your lock-screen. None of this is to diminish the hardware changes that are present on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but AI takes the starring role here. And it's quite a star turn at that.\n\nPrice and value:  If there's one blemish to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it's that the phone continues to cost more than rival flagships. At $1,299, this phone costs $100 more than the most expensive flagships from Apple and Google. But at least Samsung managed to avoid price increases this year, and the base model of the Galaxy S25 Ultra offers 256GB of storage.  Galaxy S25 Ultra deals  let you whack down the price of this phone a bit.\n\nCamera performance:  The biggest hardware change to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera setup involves an upgraded ultrawide sensor \u2014 it's now 50MP for more detailed shots and sharper macros. But upgrades to the ProVisual Engine that processes photos have paid off big for this year's Galaxy devices, and the S25 Ultra reaps the rewards.\n\nWhen my colleague Mark Spoonauer put the  S25 Ultra up against the iPhone 16 Pro Max in an 11-round photo face-off , the Galaxy S25 Ultra wound up winning more rounds. In particular, Samsung's phone excels at zooms, selfies and low-light shots. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is also proving it's better at zooming against the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n\nThere are still some areas where the iPhone 17 Pro Max takes better shots, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra photo output has improved enough to make me conclude that this is the best camera phone you can buy right now.\n\nBattery and charging:  Samsung didn't increase the battery size from the  Galaxy S24 Ultra , but even so, this year's model outlasted its predecessor on our battery test by 45 minutes. The Galaxy S25 Ultra was able to surf the web over cellular for 17 hours and 14 minutes, the longest time we've recorded for a Samsung device. Credit the Snapdragon 8 Elite inside the phone for improving power efficiency.\n\nCharging speeds are unchanged from the previous few Ultra models, though Samsung has nominally added Qi2 wireless charging support. However, since the phone doesn't feature magnets on its back for a more secure fit with Qi2 charging pads, you're losing many of the benefits of the new charging standard unless you buy a Qi2-ready case.\n\nOverall performance:  The Snapdragon 8 Elite inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra does more than just help the new phone last longer on a charge. It also delivers some of the best performance we've seen on an Android device, especially since Samsung is using an overclocked version of the silicon. That helps the Galaxy S25 Ultra produce better benchmark numbers than the OnePlus 13, which also has a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. But the gaming-focused  Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro  can lay claim to the speed king title, thanks to its numbers on some tests.\n\nThe neural engine on the Snapdragon 8 Elite coupled with 12GB of RAM on the base model give the Galaxy s25 Ultra enough processing muscle to handle more AI tasks on device. And the Galaxy S25 Ultra comes with a bigger, brighter display than last year's model so everything from gaming to streaming looks better on this new device.\n\nVerdict:  The Galaxy S25 Ultra proves that big hardware changes aren't necessary to make a splash in the smartphone world. The Galaxy AI features debuting on this year's premium Samsung phone are reason enough to upgrade, especially if you've got an older phone. And the improved cameras, longer battery life and brighter screen add to the value, even if you find the Galaxy S25 Ultra's high price a little hard to swallow.\n\nRead the full review:  Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n\nAttributes\n\nNotes\n\nRating\n\nPrice\n\nAs great a phone as the Galaxy S25 Ultra is, $1,299 is a lot to pay for a handset, especially when you can get an iPhone 16 Pro Max or Galaxy 9 Pro XL for $100 less.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nCameras\n\nThe camera competition between the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro is a tight one. But based on the head-to-head shots we've taken so far, the better zooms and low-light images help the S25 Ultra edge out the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nPower\n\nThe days of Android phones playing second fiddle to Apple on performance are over. The Galaxy S25 Ultra excels in graphics testing and even beats the best iPhones in some CPU speed tests. A vapor chamber helps keep the phone cool\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBattery life\n\nThe longest-lasting Samsung phone ever manages to outlast the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which was no slouch in the battery department, even with the same sized battery. Credit the Snapdragon 8 Elite for top power management features.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nOur expert review:\n\nEveryone was fretting on how Google was planning to price the  Pixel 9a  ahead of the phone's spring launch, but the company's decision to keep its midrange phone at the same $499 price as the Pixel 8a is a welcome relief. The cost of the Pixel 9a looks even better now that Apple is charging $599 for its cheapest phone, the  iPhone 16e .\n\nLooking at this  best cheap phone  contender, I can tell you that it's upgraded in every way, including its design. You can't help but appreciate how the Pixel 9a  brings back a long forgotten phone design  with its nearly flush camera design on the back of the phone. I admit to being a fan of the horizontal camera bar on other Google phones, but the Pixel 9a's look has its advantages, too.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pixel 9a makes for a compelling option with its Tensor G4 chip, larger 6.3-inch Actua display, bigger battery, and more AI features. After my colleague John Velasco reviewed the Pixel 9a, I can agree that it's the budget phone to beat with the most value.\n\nPrice and value:  In addition to sparing your budget with its $499 price, the Pixel 9a should last you a very long time. Google provides the same seven years of software and security updates as the pricier Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL models.\n\nIf the price isn't enough to convince you, just know that there are  Pixel 9a deals  that discount the phone even more from its normal price, while also throwing in freebies.\n\nCamera performance:  While the somewhat flush camera design on the back of the phone is a stark change over the previous camera bar designs we've seen from Google, the Pixel 9a also gets its share of hardware upgrades. There's now a 48MP main camera that pairs with a 13MP ultrawide. While the main camera is down from the Pixel 8a's 64MP one, it features a wider f/1.7 aperture that allows it to better capture photos under low light.\n\nJohn Velasco put this to this test in his Pixel 9a review and it definitely shows big improvements across the board, including closeups because the Pixel 9a finally gets a proper macro mode \u2014 along with a new astrophotography mode. The  Pixel 9a beat the iPhone 16e in our camera face-off  that pitted the top two midrange camera phones against one another.\n\nBattery and charging:  Like the Pixel 9 Pro we also rate among the best phones \u2014 see below \u2014 the Pixel 9a beats the average smartphone's performance on our battery test. The Pixel 9a was able to surf the web for 13 hours and 8 minutes before tapping out, which is an improvement over the Pixel 8a's time of 11 hours and 21 minutes.\n\nImproving battery life by more than 2 hours over its predecessor shows that Google is on the right track when it comes to bolstering the battery life of its phones. In this case, credit goes to the Pixel 9a's larger 5,100 mAh battery and power efficient Tensor G4 chip.\n\nOverall performance:  Speaking of performance, AI features continue to be a big part of the Pixel 9a's story because of how it's equipped to handle them with the Tensor G4 running the show. This effectively matches the feature set found on Pixel 9 flagships, with  Pixel Studio  and  Add Me  photo-editing features stealing the show.\n\nBut don't sleep on the phone's call management features, either, as I think they're some of the best AI features on the Pixel and unique to Google's phones. John says in his review how he loves the Call Screen feature to have Google Assistant take phone calls on his behalf, complete with contextual responses he can choose.\n\nJust be aware that some Pixel 9 AI features are missing here \u2014 notably the Pixel Screenshot app for retrieving screenshot info saved on your phone and auto-generated notes for recorded phone calls. These require more RAM and a more robust version of Gemini Nano than what the Pixel 9a offers.\n\nForget about blazing speeds, though, as that's not in the Tensor chips' locker. That said, the Pixel 9a does handily out-perform the $399  Galaxy A36 , which uses a lower-powered Snapdragon chipset. However, it trails the A18's performance with the iPhone 16e.\n\nVerdict:  The Pixel 9a is a superb contender that continues to prove how budget phones can rival flagship models. Every aspect of the phone has been improved over its predecessor. From its much bright (and larger) screen, to its longer battery life, and better camera performance, it's a fantastic option for anyone. Best of all, it gets nearly all of the AI features found with the more expensive Pixel 9 models.\n\nRead the full review:  Google Pixel 9a\n\nAttributes\n\nNotes\n\nRating\n\nPrice\n\nGoogle keeps its midrange phone under $500, making the Pixel 9a one of the better values you can find if you don't want to pay flagship prices.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nCameras\n\nWith an updated 48MP main camera paired with a 13MP ultrawide, the Pixel 9a not only take better photos, but it also gets proper macro and astrophotography modes.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nPower\n\nThe Pixel 9a uses the most recent Tensor G4, which effectively gives it nearly the same AI features found with the rest of the Pixel 9 series.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nBattery ", "excerpt": "We've reviewed dozens of handsets to find the best phones at a wide range of prices\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.
