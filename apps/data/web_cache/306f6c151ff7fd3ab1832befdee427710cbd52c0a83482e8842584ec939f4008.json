Why Trust Us?\n\nLooking for the perfect pair? Try our five shoe-buying strategies to find the right fit.\n\nWith so many running shoes out there, it\u2019s difficult to narrow down which pair is right for you. When our test team approaches evaluating shoes, we focus on three main factors:  how they fit , how comfortable they are, and how they ride. We know every runner is different and that all of the above is subjective. It helps to know what features to look for, as well as finding a shoe expert, like at your  local shoe store , for guidance. They can look at your  gait pattern  to see if you need a neutral or stability shoe.\n\nWe know shopping online is easier, but trying on shoes in-person is your best bet in finding the perfect pair. Most retailers\u2014online and in-store\u2014will offer a risk-free trial period so you can still lace up your shoes and head out for a test run. (Just double check the return policy, and always keep the box in case you do need to send them back or swap sizes.)\n\nWhether you shop online or in-store, we\u2019re here to help. Read on for a list of our favorite shoes right now in your favorite category, a breakdown of shoe anatomy, and common shoe-buying mistakes.\n\nWe review hundreds of shoes every year here at Runner\u2019s World, so we\u2019ve compiled the best shoes for all types of runners and preferences. Whether you want lots of plush cushioning, maximum ground feel, or something in between, we have the shoe for you below.\n\nWhat makes the Adidas Adizero Evo SL so special? It\u2019s a race-inspired trainer with enough cushioning and durability for regular use.\n\nWith its $110 price, it costs $40 to 50 less than typical trainers, but it still offers solid performance for day-to-day running. \u201cIt\u2019s a budget shoe, but doesn\u2019t feel like a low-end shoe,\u201d said one  RW  tester.\n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about this shoe is its massive midsole: Just over 42mm tall at the heel, it\u2019s exceptionally thick. And it features a new foam\u2014DNA Tuned\u2014that\u2019s infused with nitrogen gas.\n\nThe selections below are our Editors\u2019 Choice selections from our most recent shoe guides. We chose the following top models based on extensive feedback from runners as well as test results from the RW Shoe Lab.\n\n\u2192  Find more of our favorite shoes for any type of run here .\n\nAfter a complete top-to-bottom redesign, this shoe is somehow both softer and faster, with a pillowy step that lets you run hard and recover quickly.\n\nAsics uses its PEBA-based FF Turbo+ cushioning, which creates a firm, but highly responsive ride that\u2019s fun at high speeds. Each footstrike rebounds off the ground efficiently without hesitation.\n\nThe carbon fiber plate embedded in the soft foam adds some rigidity and propels you forward, while a sharp toe spring delivers a powerful toe-off that one tester called \u201csnappy and springy.\u201d\n\nSuper shoes  have come a long way since Nike released the Vaporfly 4% in 2018. We\u2019ve compiled a list of carbon-fiber plate shoes for every kind of runner, including racing shoes for wide foot shapes and for runners who need more support.\n\n\u2192  Find more carbon plate running shoes .\n\nThe Endorphin Speed feels like a party trick\u2013equally soft and responsive underfoot while racing, running a workout, jogging through a rest day, or pounding out a long run.\n\nThe Vomero has always been the thicker, plusher cousin of the brand\u2019s do-it-all Pegasus, but the latest version\u2019s 46mm stack height puts the shoe on the bleeding edge of maximalist cushioning.\n\nThe shoe\u2019s massive slab of midsole foam isn\u2019t great for ground feel, as one tester lamented, but even he was ultimately won over by the shoe's combination of softness, responsiveness, and stability.\n\nThe shoes shown here give you that ahhh feeling of plush-cloud comfort, more so than any other category, in  both our lab and the wear tests .\n\n\u2192  Find more cushioned running shoes .\n\nHoka strips away all the bulk without sacrificing its signature cushioning. We liked the balance of lightweight with Hoka plush in this responsive trainer.\n\nTrail shoes tend to be weighed down by their rubber outsoles. Asics resolved this issue by saving weight with a cutout pattern on its outsole, revealing the Flow midsole underneath the shoe.\n\nIf you want to construct a lightweight shoe, why not eliminate the outsole? For the past couple of years, Under Armour\u2019s Velociti line has churned out shoes with rubber-less bottoms\n\nOur lab data charts reported these road and trail shoes as the lightest in the bunch. Our wear-testers raved about how effortless the miles felt in these picks, and they loved the sensation of not being weighed down.\n\n\u2192  Find more lightweight running shoes .\n\nThe GT-2000 13\u2019s wide base employs a flared midsole and a generously beveled heel to provide a solid, stable foundation, with lateral supports that help the foot stay aligned.\n\nThe Fresh Foam X 860 v14 ditches its rigid medial post for an EVA stability plate, which allows for more flexibility without sacrificing support.\n\nAs one of the most cushioned stability shoes out there, the Saucony Hurricane 24 is especially well suited to easing the burden on your legs as you push to the brink on high-mileage runs.\n\nStability shoes feel sturdy, like they\u2019re bracing your foot and guarding against extra motion that could cause injury. These choices are rock-solid picks for feeling secure.\n\n\u2192  Find more stability running shoes .\n\nBuilding on the success of the Lone Peak 9, Altra\u2019s Lone Peak 9+ swaps out the in-house outsole rubber for Vibram Megagrip, one of the top outsole compounds for trail running.\n\nThe versatile design allows the Ultraventure 4 to transition effortlessly between trails and roads, offering reliable performance in both environments.\n\nThink of the DRX Defy Grvl as a true hybrid shoe that excels on surfaces that are rougher or more uneven than pavement\u2014gravel, cinders, cobblestones, or even cracked and unmaintained asphalt.\n\nWhen you\u2019re going off-road, your shoes need extra traction and durability. We tested the following shoes on our own trails and they passed with flying colors.\n\n\u2192  Check out more of our favorite trail shoes .\n\nEach part of the running shoe has a specific purpose and is designed to fit the foot a certain way. Even the slightest differentiation may affect your experience. We\u2019ve broken down the running shoe\u2019s main elements so you can easily identify them and make sure each fits your foot properly when deciding what to buy. (For a deeper dive, you can learn more about  the anatomy of a running shoe .)\n\nEverything above the sole counts as part of your running shoe\u2019s  upper . Traditionally, shoe brands crafted their uppers with layers of fabrics and mesh sewn and glued together. Today\u2019s modern versions increasingly use knitting and 3D printing to create seamless one-piece fits that stretch and support in appropriate places. It should lay smooth wherever it touches\u2014not binding, chafing, or bunching anywhere.\n\nThe  ankle collar  is the wrap at the top of the shoe opening that holds the heel down in place. Some shoes use thick padding, while others rely more on the shape to cradle the ankle bone. Pay attention to whether your heel slips, how the padding interacts with the bones on the side of your ankles, and whether the curve on the back irritates your Achilles tendon.\n\nThe  heel counter  is a semi-rigid cup layered inside the rearfoot that cradles and supports your heel. Some shoes have an external heel wrap that serves a similar function, while more minimalist shoes have eliminated the heel counter to allow full freedom of movement. Research has shown that heel counters do not provide motion control, but they do center the heel for stable landings and support. (Both neutral shoes and stability shoes alike utilize heel counters.) Look for a heel that allows a comfortable ankle motion.\n\nThe  saddle  of the shoe is the reinforced area around the instep, the  arch of your foot  between the ball and the ankle. A saddle interacts with the laces to hold the shoe securely on the foot. Designers have developed a variety of overlays, eyelets, and lacing systems to mold them closely to any foot shape. Pay attention to how it fits and holds your foot, providing a secure feeling with no slippage while allowing for the natural doming of the arch during your stride.\n\nThe  toebox  encompasses all of the upper from the front of the eyelets to the end of the shoe. It\u2019s often capped with a reinforced toe bumper that holds the fabric off your toes and protects from stubbing, particularly in trail shoes. Look for a wide toebox that stays out of the way, allowing your forefoot to flex and spread out naturally in both width and length. It shouldn\u2019t cramp or rub your toes, either\u2014not even your pinky toe. Ideally, you should be able to wiggle each digit comfortably inside the shoe.\n\nThe  outsole  of your running shoe is where the rubber meets the road. It is often made of a variety of rubber or foam compounds placed in strategic areas to increase wear life or enhance bounce or flexibility.\n\nCompared to road shoes, trail shoes tend to be heavier. This is not just because of trail add-ons, like gaiter attachments or a rock plate in the midsole. To withstand gnarly terrain, the outsole is hardier and made of more durable rubbers, like Vibram Megagrip. Lugs also help bite onto muddy, slippery surfaces.\n\nTo make the shoe bend like your foot bends, many shoes use flex grooves under the ball of the foot. Turning the toe up, called toe spring, or cutting away the midsole into a rocker pattern also allows the foot to roll through the stride. Small differences in location or angle can alter the mechanics and feel, and what degree of flex works best for your stride as it changes with speed.\n\nRocker-style midsoles tend to have more aggressive toe springs to facilitate a quick forward roll through the gait cycle.  Look for a shoe that flexes or rolls the way your foot wants to move\u2014at the pace for which you\u2019ll be using the shoes.\n\nThe midsole is foam material between the outsole and the upper, designed to cushion the runner from impact forces and guide the foot through the stride. Every runner will have their own preferences. Choose a midsole thickness and material that feels right at running speeds, meets your desired level of softness or firmness, and doesn\u2019t have excess weight.\n\nHeel cushioning  is the midsole material designed to minimize the impact shock of a heel strike. Besides using a variety of cushioning materials, some shoes feature a softer \u201ccrash pad\u201d area on the outer edge of the foot or a rounded outer heel to smooth the landing.\n\nResearch has shown that the body provides the majority of cushioning for your joints and that you land harder in a more cushioned shoe, so heel cushioning is largely a matter of perceived comfort. You\u2019ll likely want a balance between cushioning, stability, and ground feel. During your test runs, note whether the shoe touches down where you expect it to and rolls into the stride smoothly.\n\nForefoot cushioning  is designed to reduce the impact of the largest forces of the stride that occur at the front of the foot during loading and push off. While body mechanics largely provide cushioning to everything above the ankle, forefoot shoe cushioning protects the structures of the foot. The promise of new \u201cenergy-return\u201d materials and designs is that they can both protect and propel your foot. Pay attention to the shoe\u2019s responsiveness, looking for a balance between cushioning comfort and a firm push-off platform.\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop , or drop, is the difference in height between your heel and the ball of your foot when standing in the shoe. Experts disagree on the importance of drop related to injuries (remember  Vibram Fivefingers ?), but agree that changing drop distributes forces differently to the foot and leg, and can alter your stride. Pick a shoe that feels right throughout the stride, from touchdown to toe-off, and reduces stress on any weak parts of your foot. Zero-drop shoes, like those made by Altra, place both the heel and toe equidistant from the ground.\n\nDesigners use a variety of  stability technologies  (such as medial posts, dual-density foams, varus wedges, guide rails, and wider shoe geometries) to try to keep the foot from excessive motion, primarily overpronation or rolling inward. Scientists agree that most people do not need pronation support, but control and stability devices appear to help some runners maintain their preferred movement path. Your shoe should offer stability as support, not over-correction. If you overpronate, you may want a shoe that provides more of these stabilizing features.\n\nA  sockliner , also called an insole, is the removable pad of foam inside the shoe that cushions the contours of the bottom of your foot. Along with shoe geometry, it provides most of what people think of as \u201carch support\u201d and gives the shoe its initial step-in comfort. Pay attention to how the shoe feels on the run, where softer is not always better and the foot works dynamically to provide its own support and cushioning. If you wear an  orthotic , make sure it also fits inside your shoe comfortably.\n\nSpecialty running store staffers see runners making the same mistakes again and again when they come in to buy shoes. But not you, not anymore, thanks to this advice from five prominent store owners and managers.\n\nMistake 1: Buying for looks.\n\n\u201cWe try to encourage every guest we work with to focus on fit, feel, and function over fashion. Making sure it is the right shoe for your specific needs is paramount. If the shoe doesn't perform for you, then it doesn\u2019t really matter what it looks like.\u201d\u2014Michael Zabrodski,  Philadelphia Runner \u00a0(Philadelphia, PA)\n\nMistake 2: Not asking for deals.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to pay, ask if there are any discounts available for running club members. Most specialty stores offer discounts from 10- to 20 percent; we offer 10 percent to our local track club. It costs $20 to join it, so if you buy two pairs of shoes, your track membership is paid for.\u201d\u2014Tim Rhodes,  Run For Your Life \u00a0(Charlotte, NC)\n\nMistake 3: Buying shoes that are too small.\n\n\u201cTight-fitting shoes lead to blisters and black toenails and that kind of thing. Women in particular are used to wearing their shoes close-fitting, as they\u2019re often more self-conscious about the size of their feet. We like to say, \u2018Play the piano with your toes,\u2019 meaning the fit should be roomy enough in the forefoot\u2014about half an inch\u2014but not sloppy.\u201d\u2014Mike Johnson,  Road Runner Sports \u00a0(San Diego, CA)\n\nMistake 4: Shopping at the wrong time of day.\n\n\u201cA lot of times people come in the morning and say, \u2018This is the shoe I need.\u2019 Then they\u2019ll come back the next day and say, \u2018I wore them at 5 p.m. and they were too small.\u2019 Your feet start swelling in the morning and they don\u2019t stop until about 4 p.m. That\u2019s as big as they\u2019re going to get, so always buy your shoes in the evening.\u201d\u2014Tish Borgen,  Running Room \u00a0(Minneapolis, MN)\n\nMistake 5: Assuming your size.\n\n\u201cPeople assume that a size is a size\u2014that an 8 in a Nike will be the same as an 8 in a New Balance. But sizes differ because of different lasts (foot forms), the different shape of the upper, and the way the shoe is stitched together. Have your feet measured every time you buy, and always try the shoes on for fit.\u201d\u2014Johnny Halberstadt, cofounder of the  Boulder Running Company \u00a0(Boulder, CO)\n\nGet the Program\n\nGet the Program\n\nGet the Program\n\nGet the Program\n\nGet the Program\n\nGet the Program\n\nGet the Program\n\nGet the Program\n\nGet the Program\n\nAdditional reporting by Amy Gorin and Jennifer Van Allen\n\nThe Best Running Shoes of 2025\n\nThe 7 Best Compression Socks for Running\n\n15 Common Running Injuries and How to Treat Them\n\nThe Minimum Effective Dose Of Strength Training\n\nThe Best Comfy Walking Shoes for Wearing Every Day\n\nHow to Improve Your Running Recovery Plan\n\nThe 10 Best Hoka Running Shoes of 2025\n\nCouch to 5K Training Plan\n\nThe Top Running Gear Deals of Prime Day Are Here\n\nBest Stability Running Shoes for Ultimate Support\n\nThe 10 Best Running Shoes for Flat Feet\n\nWhat\u2019s a Good Beginner Marathon Time?\n\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\n\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n\n\u00a92025 Hearst Magazines, Inc.

But not you, not anymore, thanks to this advice from five prominent store owners and managers.TipsFinal Shoe Buying TipsGo to a specialty running shop, not a big-box or department store. A salesperson will observe your gait and bring a selection of shoes that they believe best fit your needs. They\u2019ll let you try each one, and help you narrow it down to the right choice.Get your feet measured. You may think you know your size, but your feet change over time, and one model\u2019s fit can be drastically different from another\u2019s.When you go shopping, bring along the shoes, socks, and inserts you\u2019ve been using.
