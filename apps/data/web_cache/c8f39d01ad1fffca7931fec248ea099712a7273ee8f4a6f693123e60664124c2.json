You can find plenty of high-quality laptops that cost less than $1,000. I'm talking about well-crafted, powerful computers that can compete with the  best laptops on the market \u00a0when tackling productivity and entertainment workloads.\n\nIt certainly helps that many budget laptops were former high-end devices. Apple, for example, frequently drops the price of older MacBooks whenever a new one comes out. It also helps that sometimes newer computers only provide an incremental upgrade, allowing the previous generations to continue performing years after launch. MacBooks are one of these series, and it's why we often highlight MacBook discounts on ZDNET.\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage:  Add us as a preferred Google source  on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nZDNET's experts carefully test many different laptops at release, putting them through their paces in order to provide our readers with the best advice on what you should buy. Our pick for the best laptop under $1,000 is none other than the  M2 MacBook Air , due to its solid performance, portability, and HD display. As great as it may be, the MacBook Air isn't perfect for every use case. The  HP OmniBook X Flip , for instance, has a nicer 3K touchscreen, perfect for creative work, while the  Dell 14 Plus  is a nice, everyday laptop.\n\nCheck out our other top picks for the best laptops under $1,000.\n\nAlso:\u00a0 The best Lenovo laptops\n\nWhy we like it:\u00a0 The M2 MacBook Air is easily my favorite laptop under $1,000 for several reasons. A big part of my adoration is thanks to the performance coming from Apple's M2 chip. It is notably fast and responsive, especially when multitasking or running creative apps. The 10-core GPU can tackle graphics-heavy tasks with ease. It's also well-optimized for longevity, capable of lasting two full workdays on a single charge. The praise doesn't stop there. It packs a stunning 13.6-inch Retina display, a sharp 1080p webcam, and a booming quad-speaker system.\n\nReview:  Apple M2 MacBook Air\n\nWho it's for:  The M2 MacBook Air is a smart pick for any budget-conscious shoppers who want to be a part of the Apple ecosystem and want that strong day-to-day performance. I cannot stress enough just how good the M2 chipset is, even in 2025. Students, office professionals, writers, and anyone who works primarily in browsers will enjoy this machine. The best part is that all this hardware is packed in a lightweight, travel-friendly package.\n\nWho should look elsewhere: \u00a0The M2 MacBook is also one of the more expensive options on this list, so if you're on a really tight budget, then I would suggest checking out another laptop -- namely, the M1 MacBook, which has a longer battery and is cheaper. Similarly, people looking for more horsepower should probably consider a MacBook Pro.\n\nApple M2 MacBook Air tech\u00a0 specs: CPU Model:\u00a0 Apple M2 | \u00a0RAM Memory: \u00a08GB\u00a0| \u00a0Hard Disk Drive: \u00a0256GB SSD\u00a0| \u00a0Screen Size: \u00a013.6 inches\n\nWhy we like it:\u00a0 The M2 MacBook Air is easily my favorite laptop under $1,000 for several reasons.

Enjoying modern games in high resolution without performance issues requires powerful components. Many of the best models cost over $1,000, but Lenovo's LOQ 15 is an outlier.\n\nThere are several variations available on Best Buy. The one I recommend has an AMD Ryzen 7 7435H processor, 16GB of memory, 512GB of storage, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card. That alone makes the laptop well worth the purchase, as you'll be able to play the latest AAA titles in superb quality. Additionally, the display runs at a refresh rate of 144Hz, ensuring smooth on-screen animations.\n\nAlso:\u00a0 Lenovo's new Legion Go 2 could be the ergonomic handheld I've been waiting for\n\nWho it's for:  I recommend this laptop to anyone who wants an affordable gaming laptop for themselves or someone else in their life. The RTX 4060 GPU is from the previous generation of Nvidia GPUs, and it is still a solid component today. In fact, I own a gaming laptop with this graphics card, and I get a lot of enjoyment out of it.\n\nWho should look elsewhere:  The biggest downside to this laptop is its battery life. Best Buy's product listing states the Lenovo LOQ 15 only lasts about four hours before tapping out. That is a poor battery life, but not super surprising. Gaming laptops aren't exactly known for their long-lasting batteries. It comes with the territory. Also, customer reviews complain about the laptop's fan noise; it gets pretty loud.\n\nLenovo LQ 15 tech specs: CPU Model: \u00a0AMD Ryzen 7 7435H\u00a0| \u00a0RAM Memory: \u00a016GB\u00a0| \u00a0Hard Disk Drive: \u00a0512GB SSD\u00a0|\u00a0 Screen Size: \u00a015.6 inches\n\nWhy we like it:\u00a0 Finding a  budget gaming laptop \u00a0can be difficult.

One minute, you can be using a traditional laptop, typing away on the keyboard, and the next, after flipping the display around, you can be drawing on a tablet. Among the low-cost options, the Lenovo Yoga 7i is the best because it punches well above its price.\n\nWhether you're multitasking with dozens of tabs, doing creative work, or playing an indie game, its performance is quick and reliable. The build quality is top-notch, complete with sturdy hinges, an aluminum chassis that fits comfortably in your arms, and a responsive touchscreen. All these features working together make switching between laptop, tablet, and tent modes effortless. It's a well-optimized machine that gets all the fundamentals right.\n\nReview:\u00a0 Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1\n\nWho it's for:  I recommend the laptop to people on a budget who want a versatile machine for school or office work. Students, in particular, will appreciate the flexibility that the Yoga 7i brings to the table. It can tackle a wide range of tasks across its different modes. Lenovo's machine is highly versatile, and the best part is you won't have to pay flagship prices.\n\nWho should look elsewhere:  Lenovo's Yoga 7i is not recommended for people looking for a bright screen or planning to work outdoors often. The display tops out at 300 nits. Similarly, creators who rely on color accuracy or users who want an ultra-lightweight laptop might also want to pass. It weighs nearly five pounds.\n\nLenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1\u00a0 tech specs: CPU Model: \u00a0Intel Core Ultra 5 Series 1\u00a0|\u00a0 RAM Memory:\u00a0 16GB | \u00a0Hard Disk Drive: \u00a0 512GB SSD\u00a0| \u00a0Screen Size: \u00a016 inches\n\nWhy we like it:\u00a0 The flexibility of 2-in-1 laptops offers unique utility.

There are multiple and more expensive versions of this laptop, but\u00a0the model that I recommend runs on the Snapdragon X Plus. This is one of Qualcomm's premier laptop chipsets and can handle everything you throw at it. Performance feels snappy, fluid, and efficient. It's also energy efficient, allowing the Galaxy Book4 Edge to have a long-lasting battery life of up to 13 hours.\n\nZDNET Editor Kyle Kucharski enjoyed how premium the laptop felt. It's solid and thin without any screen wobble. Samsung also didn't skimp on the ports, providing a wide range to users. It's refreshing to see so many options present, as slim machines tend to only have a few inputs.\n\nReview:\u00a0 Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge\n\nWho it's for:  This laptop is perfect for people who value portability, quiet operation, and a long battery life. It's also a great fit for those who want native access to AI features in Windows Copilot+. If you spend most of your time browsing, writing, streaming, or working in Google apps, you'll love this laptop too.\n\nWho should look   elsewhere:  The Snapdragon X Plus chipset is an ARM-based SoC (system on a chip). This type of architecture enables an energy-efficient laptop that performs well. But because it's ARM-based, certain legacy apps may not work or run poorly on the Galaxy Book4 Edge.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book4 Edge specs: CPU Model:  Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus\u00a0|  RAM Memory:  16GB |  Hard Disk Drive: \u00a0512GB   |  Screen Size:  15.6 inches\n\nWhy we like it:  Samsung's Galaxy Book4 Edge is the perfect travel companion, weighing just a little over three pounds.

It has a similar design pattern to Apple's machine, from the rubber keyboard on a pale white laptop to the vibrant screen.\n\nThis device is notably lightweight at just 2.84 pounds. It has a sharp 2K OLED screen and delivers great performance, thanks in part to its 32GB of RAM. The HP laptop also has an absurdly long battery. During testing, the computer lasted a full 25 hours on a single charge. No other laptop that I've reviewed in 2025 has lasted that long.\n\nReview:\u00a0 HP OmniBook 5\n\nWho it's for:\u00a0 The HP OmniBook 5 is perfect for students, professionals working on a budget, as well as Apple users who would like to continue having a MacBook-like experience on Windows. Its solid hardware allows the machine to tackle light creative workloads and multitasking with relative ease. Because of its long-lasting battery, the laptop is highly recommended for those who want a new everyday computer.\n\nWho should look elsewhere:\u00a0 HP's model runs on an AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 processor, which is a Windows-on-ARM chipset. This component allows the computer to run for\u00a025 hours but comes at the cost of software inoperability. Some apps might not work on this machine. Another issue is its glossy screen. It reflects so much light that it can be hard to see when in brightly lit conditions.\n\nHP OmniBook 5 tech specs: CPU Model:  AMD Ryzen AI 5 340\u00a0| \u00a0RAM Memory: \u00a016GB LPDDR5\u00a0| \u00a0Hard Disk Drive: \u00a0512GB | \u00a0Screen Size:\u00a0 16 inches\n\nWhy we like it:\u00a0 HP's 2025 OmniBook 5 is the closest you can get to a MacBook experience on Windows.

The HP OmniBook X Flip 16 bucks this trend as every single configuration comes with a great screen. This model provides two types of panels. The cheaper OmniBook X has a 16-inch 2K IPS edge-to-edge touchscreen with a maximum brightness of 400 nits. \"Edge-to-edge\" in this instance refers to the display's thin bezels, giving users expansive viewing.\n\nThe other OmniBook X takes things up a notch by having a 3K OLED touchscreen that delivers vibrant colors. Such a display allows the HP laptop to be fantastic for video editing and other forms of creative work. Outside of the screen, the device has a lot going for it. It is surprisingly lightweight for a 16-inch laptop, and the speakers pump out crystal-clear audio with punchy bass.\n\nReview:\u00a0 HP OmniBook X Flip 16\n\nWho it's for:\u00a0 HP's OmniBook X Flip 16 is perfect for creative professionals, students, and just about everyone who wants a large-screen Windows machine without breaking the bank. As mentioned, it's well-suited for content creation because of its vibrant display and stylus support.
