Check out 10 great picks that cost less than a grand\u2014ultraportables, gaming laptops, 2-in-1s, even a MacBook Air\u2014all tested and vetted by PC Labs.\n\nPC shopping on a budget is hard, especially when the  best laptops  are often four-figure investments. We get it; we've been reviewing laptops for 40 years (back when  all  of them were truly exorbitant). Our analysts and editors have decades of experience reviewing portable PCs and sifting out the best values. At PC Labs, we benchmark laptops for CPU and graphics performance using rigorous benchmark tests; we also test and assess display quality, battery life, connectivity, and, of course, value. Every  budget laptop  is a balance of strengths and trade-offs, and our current best Windows laptop under $1,000 for most people is the Dell 14 Plus (DB14250), which brings peppy everyday performance to homes and students. We also recommend the 2025 Apple MacBook Air M4 as a great general-use Mac. Read on for details on those and more of the best under-$1,000 laptops we've tested, plus a detailed buying guide and a handy spec comparison.\n\nAugust 12, 2025: With this update, we added the Dell 14 Plus (DB14250) as our latest Best Laptop Under $1,000, replacing the discontinued Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406). We've also added the Apple MacBook Air 13-Inch (2025, M4) as our new Best MacBook Under $1,000, replacing the 2020 Apple MacBook Air M1. Other changes: The Acer Nitro V 15 (ANV15-41-R2Y3) is our new Best Gaming Laptop Under $1,000, and the Snapdragon X-based Asus Zenbook A14 is our new Best Ultraportable Laptop Under $1,000. Last of all, we added the Framework Laptop 13 (2025) in a new category, Best Laptop Under $1,000 for Long-Term Savings. Since our last update, we have tested and evaluated\u00a0 more than two dozen new laptops \u00a0for inclusion in this roundup and our other laptop roundups. We are currently testing 15 laptops from Asus, Dell, Lenovo, and others for our next update.\n\nDell's freshly rebranded 14 Plus is a full-metal, nearly ultraportable midrange laptop, with a punchy and comfortable keyboard and lots of ports, including Thunderbolt 4. Our test unit had a crisp, color-rich 1600p IPS screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, which is optional. Dell built this laptop to nail everyday computing tasks like homework, bill management, and web browsing for long sessions with 20 hours of battery life. Its list price might not be fantastic, but we've seen the Dell 14 Plus for as little as $699.99, which makes it an absolute steal.\n\nThe Dell 14 Plus is ideal for everyday home users who need to check their favorite websites, keep up with their home finances, and edit photos or home videos. This laptop is also a shoo-in for students, thanks to its affordability and just enough punch for homework. The pixel-dense screen, sharp webcam, and high-quality speakers will also make remote learning better. As a Copilot+ PC, the Dell 14 Plus also has a dedicated AI processor inside to access Microsoft's entire suite of on-device AI tools in Windows 11.\n\nOur favorite under-$1,000 laptop for most shoppers is the Apple MacBook Air 13-Inch (2025, M4), which earned our Editors' Choice award for not only bringing up the level of performance with the M4 chip, but also dropping the price to $999, finally making Apple's lightest laptop more affordable. The base model gets more memory than the year before, an improved Center Stage camera, and boosted performance while keeping the same fanless, silent design. If you want our favorite macOS laptop for under $1,000, this is it.\n\nThe latest 13-inch MacBook Air is the newest version of Apple's already fantastic ultraportable, but it is now selling for less than $1,000. Shoppers looking for long battery life and speedy general performance, all in a slim and portable design, will be well served by this laptop.\n\nWant to game at 1080p without paying through the nose? You won't find many gaming laptops for less than $1,000, but the Acer Nitro V 15 upstages other affordable gaming rigs. Thanks to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, this laptop drives steady frame rates at 1080p in many popular games. Acer even included a decent port selection and battery life at its affordable price, so what's not to love?\n\nBudget gamers craving an entry-level laptop that can handle mainstream games will love the Acer Nitro V 15 (ANV15-41-R2Y3). It's a potent portable gaming solution that won't kill your savings. If affordability is more critical than top-tier performance, the Acer Nitro V 15 will save you a buck without giving up too much gaming horsepower.\n\nSelling for $999, the Asus Zenbook A14 is an excellent ultraportable. It combines Qualcomm Snapdragon processing with a premium OLED display and an ultra-light design. The chassis uses magnesium alloy and Asus' Ceraluminum finish to become one of the lightest but sturdiest laptops we've tested. It's portable and easy to carry, but it doesn't skimp on performance. The laptop also includes all of Windows' Copilot+ AI features and a comprehensive collection of ports.\n\nIf you're in the market for a high-performance laptop with a super-portable design, the Asus Zenbook A14 is a smart pick. Its build is ideal for travel, and its overall design is great for anyone who needs a versatile machine with ample connectivity and AI features, all at a reasonable price.\n\nOffice laptops need potent performance, broad connectivity, and long battery life. The fact that the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 5 fills the bill for under $1,000 is a welcome surprise. This laptop may not have the carbon-fiber construction or dazzling display options of fancier ThinkPads like Lenovo's flagship X1 Carbon, but it offers one of the best keyboards in its class, versatile Thunderbolt 4 ports, and even an optional touch screen for just $50 extra. Plus, it comes with a three-year warranty, so you have peace of mind that it will keep you working longer than most machines.\n\nWith its attractive price and business-friendly features, the ThinkPad E14 Gen 5 is the laptop of choice for professionals on a budget, whether they're solo operators or cost-conscious IT managers. Its long battery life makes it ideal for business travelers as well.\n\nIf you want to save as much money as possible on a laptop\u2014we're talking  way  less than $1,000\u2014then the Acer Aspire 3 (A315-24P) is a smart buy. It's a reliable performer with smooth performance for everyday tasks, but it goes beyond the basics with high-quality Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, long battery life, and an irresistible $399 price. That's pretty hard to beat.\n\nCash-strapped shoppers will obviously love the affordable price. Still, the Acer Aspire 3 (A315-24P) is also a compelling budget laptop for students, casual users, and anyone who values long battery life. It's a great entry-level bargain.\n\nBuying a laptop with a big screen doesn't mean you have to spend a small fortune. The 2024 Acer Swift Go 16 combines a handsome 16-inch display, potent performance, and plenty of ports. The laptop also features a 1440p webcam that's a rare find among laptops priced at under a grand (or even above that price). Its Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, 32GB of standard RAM, and 1TB SSD are also hard to get in this price range.\n\nIt's the best laptop with a large screen for under $1,000 that we've tested recently, but our test configuration is locked behind Costco's warehouse doors. (It sells for a bit over $1,000 outside them.) If you're one of the 120-plus million shoppers in the U.S. with a Costco membership, check out this big-screen bargain along with your next $1.50 hot dog and soda.\n\nThough not as affordable as some Chromebooks, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 is the best ChromeOS-powered laptop we've seen. It packs a capable 2-in-1 design and a powerful Intel Core Ultra processor, plus two fistfuls of AI-powered upgrades, including a 12-month trial of Google's Gemini Advanced. We already loved the Spin 714's elegant design and high-quality construction, but the latest model ups the ante with the smartest version of ChromeOS we've ever seen.\n\nThis one is for anyone who wants the best ChromeOS has to offer. Whether you're into productivity, creativity, student life, or just chilling at home, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 is as close to perfect as Chromebooks get.\n\nConvertible 2-in-1 laptops are a tempting alternative to detachable Windows tablet-plus-keyboard combos. The HP Envy x360 14 (2024) is a convertible laptop with a slick design and a dazzling OLED display that enhances the visual experience of both a laptop and tablet. The keyboard is snappy and responsive, and the port selection provides plenty of connectivity for a slim system. Overall, this stylish and versatile design functions excellently and is priced lower than most competitors.\n\nThe HP Envy x360 14 (2024) is ideal for users who want a portable design and vivid OLED display. The stylish 2-in-1 is great for casual use, especially for users who prioritize price over performance. Simply put, this is the best 2-in-1 laptop for less than a grand that we've tested so far.\n\nThe Framework Laptop 13 (2025) is a unique option among sub-$1,000 laptops, giving shoppers a modular laptop design that lets you swap out parts, ports, and even the mainboard with relative ease, all for much less than a complete system replacement. The most recent model is on par with the best premium ultraportables, but upgrading an old unit to the latest processor calls for less cash than most complete midrange laptops. The latest model gets a powerful AMD Ryzen AI 300 processor but stays at less than three pounds. A Framework laptop costs a premium up front, but you'll start saving big after the first upgrade, not to mention the second or third.\n\nFramework's latest 13-incher is a solid machine right from the initial purchase, providing reliability and power for moderate workloads and productivity tasks at a decent price. But the real appeal is saving more with every upgrade, letting you step up to a new processor or feature set for way less than buying a whole new laptop.\n\nSign up for the  Lab Report  to receive PCMag's latest product reviews, buying advice, and insights.\n\nSign up for the  Lab Report  to receive PCMag's latest product reviews, buying advice, and insights.\n\nBy clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our  Terms of Use  and  Privacy Policy .\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nYour subscription has been confirmed. Keep an eye on your inbox!\n\nLet's start with the most critical elements of any laptop: the core components, the operating system, and its connectivity-related features. Looks may be important in a laptop, but nothing beats performance. If you don't have it where it counts, your new laptop won't do a good job of supporting the tasks you're buying it for.\n\nThe  processor  is the core computing part of any personal computer, so your laptop needs a properly scaled one. As a rule, the faster or more powerful the CPU, the more expensive the laptop, but that shouldn't deter you. For less than $1,000, you can find notebooks with peppy chips from Intel, AMD, and even some compelling options from Apple.\n\nSpecific CPUs will vary depending on what application and form factor you're after, but reviews and formal testing from reputable sources are your friends here. Intel Core and Core Ultra chips are standard in this price range, as are their AMD Ryzen equivalents. For most shoppers, a Core i5, Core Ultra 5, or Ryzen 5 class of CPU will suffice; content creators and other demanding users should favor the \"7\" level of each.\n\nA processor name that ends in \"H\" is generally a more powerful (and more battery-hungry) option here than one that ends with a \"U.\" Meanwhile, Apple shoppers may not get the latest Apple silicon (currently, M4) in an under-$1,000 laptop, unless they opt for the lowest-end 13-inch MacBook Air. But you can pick up a MacBook with a still-potent previous-generation M1 or M2 processor at a bargain price.\n\nThe CPU may be the primary component for any laptop shopper, but graphics are a significant concern for many shoppers.\u00a0Nearly all laptop processors have an integrated graphics processor (IGP) that's fast enough to show streaming videos, permit image editing or light video work, and power through solitaire or casual games (though usually not the latest fast-paced shoot-'em-ups).\n\nHowever, a dedicated graphics processing unit (GPU) is paramount for a gaming laptop. It's easy to blow your budget with expensive  gaming laptops , but a few budget options will get you in the game without leaving you too broke to buy the next  Baldur's Gate  or  Cyberpunk 2077 expansion .\n\nEven if you aren't looking to start gaming, discrete graphics hardware is a plus for multimedia work, especially video. However, laptops with discrete GPUs priced at less than $1,000 are the exception rather than the rule (apart from gaming laptops, which usually have one), so we'd recommend checking out our gaming pick in this roundup or others among our favorite  cheap gaming laptops .\n\nLaptop memory is the next ingredient for excellent performance. Having more RAM will give you more resources for multitasking, such as running multiple apps or browser tabs at once; in the case of integrated graphics, it'll mean more memory left over after the allotment that's shared with the IGP as video memory. You'll know when you don't have enough because you'll experience slow loading times, laggy responses to mouse clicks and keystrokes, and even freezing or crashing of applications and the operating system. Having enough RAM is critical for the sort of smooth experience you expect, and it never hurts to have more.\n\nFor most users, 8GB of memory is sufficient for web browsing, media streaming, and basic office work. However, 16GB is better for multitasking with more than a few programs, editing photos, or gaming\u2014and will soon become the baseline as AI-ready laptops take over the market. Meanwhile, laptops with 32GB or more are reserved for high-end gaming, heavy media work, or demanding professional applications such as running virtual machines or crunching giant datasets. Laptops for less than $1,000 with 32GB of RAM are rare, but consider buying a system with user-upgradable RAM, which lets you level up your memory via a separate purchase later on.\n\nChromebooks\u2014laptops with Google's browser-centric ChromeOS\u2014usually dominate lists of low-priced laptops, and for good reason. Their lightweight operating system makes Chromebooks ideal for students and casual users who mostly just want to get online. But if you can spend more than $500, you have no reason to feel stuck with ChromeOS unless its frequent updates and freedom from viruses appeal to you.\n\nWindows and a few macOS systems are readily available for less than $1,000 and come with all the features of those leading operating systems. Whether you're a Windows fan who wants the Microsoft 365 (formerly Office) suite or an Apple die-hard looking to add a laptop to your iPhone and  Apple Watch  ecosystem, you can get a machine that fits your budget.\n\nOne area where you shouldn't compromise is connectivity. From USB-C ports to Wi-Fi 6 or 6E, it's rare for a $1,000 laptop not to have every port or connection you want. But that doesn't mean that all laptops will have all the physical connectors. In fact, some of the most premium systems you can buy sacrifice ports for slim design, leaving off handy extras such as memory card slots, headphone jacks, or HDMI monitor ports.\n\nThe bad news is that even pricey laptops are not immune to port shortages. The good news is that you can pick up an inexpensive  docking station  or adapter that provides whatever connectors you need.\n\nWith today's laptops taking so many different physical forms\u2014tablet PCs with detachable keyboards, flip-and-fold laptop/tablet convertibles, beefy gaming notebooks, and sleek ultraportables\u2014it would be easy to think that some form factors are simply too expensive for a guide like this. You'd be half right.\n\nGaming laptops get pricey fast, as do professional workstations. Rugged laptops for outdoor or industrial use (often by first responders or the military) are also usually way over $1,000. But the rest? You can find a vast selection of slim and light laptops, convertible hybrid devices, and business-ready laptops of every stripe for $999 or less.\n\nSome features are less common in the budget category, but that doesn't mean they're entirely unavailable. In fact, you can readily find these premium features at three- rather than four-figure prices\u2014just not all of them in one machine. Here are some luxuries you can get with careful shopping, as long as you understand you may get one or two, but not all of them, without busting your budget.\n\nDisplay quality hinges on several elements, including screen size, brightness, and refresh rate, but the most salient features you'll decide on are panel type and resolution. (Screen size, measured diagonally, is, of course, important, but it's usually dictated by laptop size.)\n\nLaptop display panels come in many forms, but the two most common today are IPS and OLED. An in-plane switching (IPS) display is a type of LCD with LED backlighting optimized for wide viewing angles and better color reproduction than older LCD options. As such, it's the go-to pick for mainstream laptops and the most common option in our list of favorites.\n\nOrganic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels are more expensive and hence are found more often on premium laptops, though their prices continue to come down. OLED is famous for sky-high contrast (its blacks are unbeatably deep because it can turn individual pixels all the way off instead of just dimming them) and more vivid colors. These displays look better and are thinner and more energy-efficient, so they're popular among the slimmest and longest-lasting ultraportables. Happily, you can find a few OLED laptops that limbo just less than $1,000, and if you want a system that looks and feels more expensive than it is, it's the display type we recommend.\n\nTouch-screen capability is separate from display quality but no less critical. Many Windows and Chromebook laptops boast touch panels and even 2-in-1 convertible designs that let you switch between laptop and tablet modes, but Apple famously snubs touch screens for all its MacBooks.\n\nA long-lasting battery is often the difference between a laptop you love to take along and one you'd rather leave at home. Knowing your machine has a long battery life, you can simply slip it into your briefcase or backpack and go, knowing that you've got hours of use ahead without worrying about finding a wall outlet. On the other hand, a short battery life means lugging around the power adapter and periodically being tethered to an outlet to recharge.\n\nThe good news is that many of the laptops in this roundup can exceed 10 or 12 hours on a charge, getting through a day of work or school and an evening's streaming entertainment. Of course, not all are marathon athletes. Gaming laptops, in particular, are known for brief battery life, even if today's models are rarely limited to the one or two hours of their ancestors. Choose accordingly.\n\nStorage was once a question of spinning  hard drives  versus solid-state drives (SSDs), but no more. The SSD has become the storage format of choice for all laptops except the cheapest Chromebooks, which use inexpensive but relatively small and sluggish eMMC flash storage instead.\n\nThe bigger question is capacity. A 128GB drive will fill up quickly, mostly taken up just by your operating system and program files, so we generally recommend 256GB as a minimum. (Chromebooks usually get a pass since they're built for the cloud instead of local storage.) If you can get a 512GB drive, you're sitting pretty for most mainstream use, but sharp-eyed shoppers will sometimes find a notebook with a 1TB SSD for less than $1,000.
