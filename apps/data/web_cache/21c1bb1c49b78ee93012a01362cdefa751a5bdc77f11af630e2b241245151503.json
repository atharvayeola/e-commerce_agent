Our analysts and editors have more than a collective century of experience telling the good laptops from the great ones. We test more than 100 models every year to determine the best laptop overall. We also rank winners in various subcategories, such as  gaming laptops , work laptops,  budget laptops , Chromebooks, and MacBooks. We test all models for CPU and graphics performance using rigorous, repeatable benchmark tests, and we evaluate design, usability, connectivity, and\u2014most important!\u2014value. Our current best laptop for most people is the Dell 14 Plus (DB14250), a top-value midranger that lasts for 20 hours on a charge, but we have plenty more tested, vetted recommendations. Read on to see all our picks, compare their specs, and get down-to-earth buying advice for nailing down the best laptop for you.\n\nOctober 1, 2025: With this update, we added the Lenovo Yoga 9i Gen 10 Aura Edition as our latest Best Convertible 2-in-1 Laptop, replacing the Asus ProArt PX13. We also swapped in the MSI Katana 15 HX in place of the Acer Nitro V 15 (ANV15-51-59MT) as our Best Budget Gaming Laptop. Our remaining picks have been vetted for currency and availability. Since our last update, we reviewed and evaluated  13 new laptops  for potential inclusion in this roundup and other laptop roundups. We're currently testing 19 laptops in PC Labs, including models from Acer, Asus, Dell, and Lenovo.\n\nWith the venerable  Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406)  discontinued, we turn to the Dell 14 Plus for a similarly high-end experience at an approachable price. While just above $1,000 at its starting list price, you'll more often than not find it for less\u2014sometimes hundreds off. At that point, this portable laptop becomes a sharp-screened steal made sweeter by the latest connectivity and lengthy battery life.\n\nDesign : Being in Dell's new midrange (\"Plus,\" formerly Inspiron) line, the 14 Plus is a decidedly plain laptop, but that's not to say it's low-quality. The Dell 14 Plus is nearly light enough to meet our standards for ultraportable laptops, and it comes in a full-metal build, which we've come to expect from systems at this level. Dell's design also includes a decent webcam and speakers for video calls, and comfortable inputs for ease of use. It even has plenty of ports for new and old devices, including Thunderbolt 4.\n\nDisplay : Dell's display is sharp, saturated, and eye-friendly. It's a 1600p IPS panel with an advanced 90Hz refresh rate but without touch controls, sticking to elevating the basics. While it's not quite as bright as we'd like, image quality remains high, with decent color coverage and contrast. At its sale price, this display becomes quite a rare feature.\n\nPerformance : In terms of speed, this is a profoundly midrange system. It's a decent laptop for homework, paying bills, and web browsing\u2014but not your go-to video editing machine or a gaming rig. Remember: This is a top laptop for  most people , not edge cases like multimedia production or playing PC games.\n\nBattery life : This is the marquee feature for the Dell 14 Plus: a long-running 20 hours of battery life. Intel's Core 200V processors were built with optimum efficiency in mind, and it shows in this battery-test result. Expect this laptop to last more than a full workday off the charger.\n\nValue for money : While its list price to start isn't extremely competitive, the Dell 14 Plus becomes an absolute steal when found on sale. We've seen it for as little as $699.99 from Dell's own website and outside of a major shopping holiday, like Prime Day. That's a serious value for what's on offer here, in a decent price range for students and kids (or bargain hunters).\n\nCasual computer users : With this level of performance capacity, the Dell 14 Plus will best serve mainstream audiences who just want to do basic computing. It's a right-on machine for home finance management, web browsing, and even basic photo editing.\n\nStudents : Kids in school of almost all ages would benefit from a laptop like the Dell 14 Plus. It's a relatively inexpensive investment with plenty of power for basic homework of almost any grade level. The high-resolution screen will make that experience easier, and its webcam and speakers will make for acceptable remote learning.\n\nAI early adopters : It's also important to mention that this is a Microsoft Copilot+ PC, meaning it has the AI processing hardware required to access the full suite of Copilot tools in Windows 11. So, this laptop has access to robust local AI features like chatbots, text editing and generation, and video call enhancements.\n\nDell has grabbed back the  mobile workstation  crown with its Precision 5690 model, a 16-inch beast with Nvidia RTX Ada graphics and one of the most powerful Intel Core Ultra processors currently available. With that combo, the Precision achieves chart-topping performance despite being just 0.87 inch thin. Speed aside, this workstation has a poppy 4K OLED touch screen housed in a high-end build with a punchy set of keys for fast typists.\n\nDesign:  With workstation hardware inside and an aluminum and reinforced polycarbonate chassis outside, the Dell Precision 5690 is durable through and through. It passes most MIL-STD 810H torture tests for durability and does it while providing industrial-grade processing and graphics. We wish it had a numeric keypad and maybe a USB-A port to go with the versatile USB-C connections, but it's hard to complain about a design this impressive.\n\nDisplay:  This workstation's 16-inch OLED touch screen has 3,840-by-2,400-pixel resolution, so it doesn't skimp on sharpness or color. It's a superb screen with richly saturated hues, crisp detail, a 400-nit brightness rating, and included color calibration tools. This panel is pro all the way.\n\nPerformance:  Every workstation is powerful, but this Dell takes the cake with Intel Core Ultra processors (configurable up to a Core Ultra 9 185H), an Nvidia RTX 5000 Ada GPU for high-end graphics, up to 64GB of RAM, and two SSDs. It's made to handle demanding tasks in design, rendering, and engineering, and its benchmark results were among the best we've ever seen.\n\nBattery life:  Workstations aren't known for lengthy battery life, but with nearly double the stamina of its closest Windows rival, the Dell Precision 5690 is a winner in this area. We just wouldn't try to carry out too many rendering or data-crunching tasks away from the outlet.\n\nValue for money:  This kind of power is never cheap, and with prices reaching more than $6,500, a fully loaded Precision 5690 isn't either. But professionals need the best, and the quality build and potent performance justify the premium cost, earning it our Editors' Choice award.\n\nProfessionals willing to invest in high performance:  The Dell Precision 5690 provides top-tier performance with its powerful Intel Core Ultra processors and Nvidia RTX 5000 Ada GPU, making it an excellent choice for professionals who require high performance for demanding applications. Its robust build quality and advanced features justify the investment, ensuring reliability and efficiency in high-stakes environments.\n\nWorkstation users who prize mobility:  Weighing just 4.46 pounds and featuring a sleek design, the Precision 5690 is highly portable, making it ideal for workstation users who need to work on the go. The Precision's powerful performance and compact form allow you to easily transport it to different locations without sacrificing capability.\n\nProfessionals who need more than just power:  This laptop is perfect for engineers, designers, and pros who require a dependable workhorse for client meetings and presentations. It delivers impressive performance for high-end applications while remaining lightweight and easy to carry without the need for extensive storage or ECC memory.\n\nThe best MacBook for most people continues to be the easiest call to make in this buying guide. Apple's 2025 MacBook Air is budget-friendlier than before, returning to a three-digit starting price. Meanwhile, its M4 processor update preserves the core Mac experience and introduces advanced AI capabilities. Aside from gaining the MacBook Pro's improved 12-megapixel Center Stage camera, nothing else has changed about the Air this year. You get the same sharp LCD screen, sublime keyboard, and large trackpad as before. The 13-inch MacBook Air remains a benchmark to which other ultraportable laptops aspire.\n\nDesign:  Apple's laptops have led the design charge for 20 years, though the latest MacBook Air carries that torch without doing much new. This year's model still measures just 0.44 inch thick and weighs a feathery 2.7 pounds. Of course, the laptop still has just two Thunderbolt 4 ports. While still an impressive exterior, this is perhaps the least exciting part of the 2025 MacBook Air update.\n\nDisplay:  Apple's pride in its display technology shows in how much mileage it draws out of each revision. This year's MacBook Air has the same 13.6-inch, 2,560-by-1,664-pixel, 16:10 LCD Liquid Retina screen. The panel hasn't changed a bit with this model, so expect the screen to hit around 363 nits of brightness while covering 100% of the sRGB and 95% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts. True Tone also returns, adapting the screen's color temperature to ambient light on the fly.\n\nPerformance:  The MacBook Air's new M4 processor still drives competitive speeds compared with laptops in its class, and it continues to punch above its weight in demanding tasks like Photoshop. Always look to a MacBook Pro for a dedicated content-creation machine, but the Air will easily handle the odd photo touch-up or video render. M4 also supports Apple's second-generation ray-tracing techniques, so Mac gaming got a slight boost, too.\n\nBattery life:  While we saw a generational decline, Apple's featherweight laptop line was still impressive in terms of battery life, at 19 hours and 56 minutes, in our rundown test. Nearly 20 hours will get you quite far, but some competitors outlasted it by several hours.\n\nValue for money : This generation's Air laptop is the most value-packed new MacBook in a while. Thanks to a $100 price cut, it has finally returned to a $999 starting price. Increasing the starting memory capacity to 16GB also makes upgrades to the storage, GPU, or memory more approachable.\n\nApple die-hards:  If you already own an iPhone or an iPad and want to stay within Apple's ecosystem, or you've been an Apple fan for some time, then this decision was already made for you. While Apple's macOS was already deeply integrated with those devices, the Sequoia update brings full iPhone Mirroring, giving you complete digital access to your iPhone from your Mac desktop.\n\nCollege students:  It's easy to deduce why you see so many MacBooks on college campuses. They're reliable, sturdy, and robust computers with excellent inputs and versatile connection options. You'll often hear of MacBook Air models lasting throughout an undergraduate's tenure. While you have to get used to macOS if you're not already familiar with it, some fields of study (particularly media, design, and the humanities) lean on Macs to get students through coursework.\n\nIt's well known that bargain-priced laptops are often riddled with compromises, and while this Acer Aspire 3 isn't exempt from those, we've ranked it as the  best budget laptop  for how it presents relatively few. We especially appreciate this notebook's lengthy battery life, decent keyboard, and reliable performance for basic tasks. You won't get a dazzling display or flashy design, but budget-strapped buyers or parents shopping for their young kids will be well served by this Aspire model.\n\nDesign:  This 15-inch Aspire model is a sub-$500 laptop, so you shouldn't expect much design flair. It covers the essentials, including a keyboard that makes for fast typing paired with a numeric keypad that's often missing from 15-inch models. The laptop also features rubber pads on the bottom of the base for added stability. Of course, what you're after at this price is the basics.\n\nDisplay:  Likewise, Acer's Aspire display covers the basics required by a screen at this price: full HD resolution and decent brightness for the price, which is helped by an anti-glare finish for improved legibility in bright settings. Of course, this laptop doesn't cover 100% of any of the three color palettes or gamuts we test for, not that you should expect that this far south of 500 bucks. Performance:  Within its class, this Aspire model produced decent performance numbers in our benchmark tests. While it won no contests, it wasn't completely blown out, either. We found the Aspire to get by just fine through basic computing tasks such as word processing and web browsing, but we wouldn't recommend pushing it much further with multimedia content creation or gaming.\n\nBattery life:  This is a high point for the Aspire, which lasted longer than any of the laptops we compared it with in our review at 16 hours and 46 minutes. That's likely thanks to its lower-power processor and relatively dim display when set to the 50% brightness we use for our battery rundown test. Regardless, this laptop is a marathon runner.\n\nValue for money:  Here's where the Acer Aspire 3 excels\u2014almost purely because of its bargain-bin price. With a list price just under $400, we've seen it dip below $300 since our review. You won't find many 15-inch laptops with 16-hour battery life for that little, not to mention one with up-to-date Wi-Fi and reliable everyday performance.\n\nBudget-strapped buyers:  Naturally, this is a first stop for anyone who's hard up for cash. Priced well south of $500 and sometimes seen for less than $300, the Acer Aspire 3 is about as low as Windows laptops go in terms of cost. However, it doesn't short-shrift budget buyers, especially on battery life and up-to-date connectivity.\n\nJack or Jill's first laptop:  Due to its low price and, therefore, a lower level of investment in the event of accidental (i.e., careless) damage, this Aspire model is ideal as your kid's first laptop, particularly for elementary school workloads. Your kiddos also won't be punished for forgetting to charge the laptop with such long battery life.\n\nLenovo's latest crack at making the  best ultraportable laptop  possible led it to its ThinkPad brand. From there, the company crafted a thin-and-light machine that exudes premium style and named it the X9. While it doesn't quite compete on value or performance, the ThinkPad X9 14 certainly rivals the MacBook Air in design. Bridging consumer and small-business needs, it's a sturdy and reliable high-end alternative to the Air.\n\nDesign:  The 14-inch ThinkPad X9 shell is partly recycled aluminum and measures just 0.51 inch thick. Lenovo's super-thin laptop weighs only 2.74 pounds, tying the MacBook Air in weight and just barely thicker. However, its underside \"wedge\" hosting its ports allows for a fan-cooled processor inside, which is not a given among ultraportable laptops and allows for a higher power ceiling under sustained loads.\n\nDisplay:  Lenovo all but perfected its OLED display tuning with the ThinkPad X9, presenting an 1800p 14-inch screen whose only color-coverage miss was a \"mere\" 98% rating for Adobe RGB. It's also among the brightest laptop screens we've tested at 505 nits. Oh, and it's a speedy 120Hz panel that can adjust the refresh rate automatically based on the content displayed.\n\nPerformance:  Intel's Core Ultra 200V \"Lunar Lake\" processors prioritize efficiency, so set your expectations accordingly for raw output. The ThinkPad X9 chassis's fan cooling helps it remain competitive, but this laptop won't win any drag races. With that in mind, the X9 will easily cut through basic computing tasks while slowly sipping on that battery.\n\nBattery life:  Speaking of which, the ThinkPad X9 lasted a cool 19 hours and 31 minutes on our battery rundown test. This result is still impressive in 2025 and competitive with the MacBook Air, but ultraportable PC laptops have started to outlast the 20-hour mark at this point. If you're dead set on breaking 20 hours, for whatever reason, then think twice; otherwise, the battery on this laptop is more than enough.\n\nValue for money:  This is the second area where the ThinkPad X9 doesn't quite keep up with the MacBook Air; it starts at $1,239. We'd normally say the OLED screen has something to do with that, but we've seen OLED on a few under-$1,000 laptops. However, it doesn't get much more premium in this price range for Windows laptops than the ThinkPad X9.\n\nFrequent travelers:  This is the kind of laptop that all but disappears in your backpack, thinner than most paperback books and lighter than some hardcovers. The ThinkPad X9 is also a long-lasting machine with fast charging that can get you back to 80% power in 60 minutes, fitting for someone always on the move.\n\nScreen snobs:  Anyone spoiled by their luxe smartphone screen will be pleased by this laptop's 1800p OLED panel. The screen is sharp and colorful, refreshing at a snappy 120Hz and shining brightly at more than 500 nits. When we say Apple's rivals are catching up to its Mac displays, we think of laptops like the ThinkPad X9.\n\nOnce again, Lenovo takes home the honor of the  best business laptop  ever made with the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition. This model takes the same crisp OLED display, light weight, class-leading keyboard, and ample port selection to the next level with a CoPilot+ PC-ready Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor. (The outgoing Gen 12 model was not CoPilot+ PC-compliant.) Lenovo is polishing its top-tier laptop at this point, adding shiny new features on top of a dominant mobile computing platform.\n\nDesign:  Still   a combination of magnesium, aluminum, and carbon fiber, Lenovo's matte-black beauty is the benchmark for business laptop design. Lenovo somehow made the laptop even lighter this year at just 2.17 pounds, which outclasses Dell's XPS 13 and Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air.\n\nDisplay:  This version of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon has the same stunning OLED panel as before, with a 2,880-by-1,800-pixel resolution, rich colors, and up to a 120Hz refresh rate. With intense brightness and wide viewing angles, it's still ready for most working environments, whether in an office or on a jet.\n\nPerformance:  Last time, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon was a potent performer but not the top dog, and Intel's \"Lunar Lake\" platform tells the same story. Lunar Lake, or Core Ultra V200-series processors, are built primarily for AI tasks and overall efficiency, so you won't see class-leading output here but rather enough to get you by in a standard working environment.\n\nBattery life:  This is another area in which we've seen massive improvement, thanks to Core Ultra V processing. Whereas the outgoing ThinkPad lasted just 13 hours and some change, this latest model outlasted that by more than six hours. This doesn't earn it an overall win against its rivals but makes it competitive on daily lasting power.\n\nValue for money:  We gave this ThinkPad X1 Carbon another Editors' Choice award and a five-star rating, a rarity for us, recognizing Lenovo's responses to previous criticisms on performance and battery life. This will never be the most affordable business ultraportable, but you get what you pay for, and here you get quite a lot for the steep price.\n\nMobile professionals:  If you travel for work or take a long bus or train commute often, this is the ultimate machine for you. With a thin, lighter, and MIL-STD 810H-certified chassis, this ThinkPad is prepared for the rigors of frequent travel. The boosted battery life and performance help keep the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon's position as a ", "excerpt": "Whether you want a simple budget PC, a productivity workhorse, or a screamer of a gaming notebook, our experts have done the heavy lifting to help you find the right laptop for the task.\n\nHere at PCMag, we've tested thousands of laptops since our lab's founding more than 40 years ago.

You'll find exceptions. A leading laptop with a 4K display and a powerful CPU may last less time, and gaming laptops deplete far sooner than most other machines. And when playing demanding GPU-taxing games? Gaming laptops run out of juice faster than most. Much depends on how you compute; even powerful laptops have become adept at sensing when maximum power isn\u2019t required, reducing various components\u2019 consumption.</p> <p>This is where PC Labs\u2019 battery testing comes in.

Some leading laptops bring these features closer to $800; check brands like Acer, Asus, and HP.</p> <p>A major caveat: In this price range, you\u2019ll have to settle on what the most essential features are for you. You might land a beautiful 4K display or a cavernous terabyte of solid-state storage, but probably not both.</p> <p>You can choose almost any combination if your budget is $2,000 or more. That said, even the most powerful laptop that money can buy must still obey the laws of physics. Powerful hardware generates heat, and the cooling mechanisms required to address that heat take up space. Hard-core gamers who want a large display and a screaming-fast graphics processor that requires bulky cooling pipes and fans won\u2019t find it in a thin, light laptop.</p> <p>IT-manageable, security-conscious business laptops\u2014models made primarily by Dell, HP, and Lenovo\u2014have their own pricing dynamic and tend to cost a bit more, all else being equal.

These are the maximum dimensions and heft a laptop can have to be considered ultraportable, and for most users, portability is the key to maximizing use and enjoyment.</p> <p>Aiming for that weight and thickness usually means a laptop with a 13- or 14-inch screen, although a few models with 15-inch or larger screens qualify. At most screen sizes, you can find models in conventional \u201cclamshell\u201d laptop or 2-in-1 designs.\u00a0</p> <p>Some Windows laptops and ChromeOS laptops do have smaller 11-inch or 12-inch displays, often not technically laptops in the classic sense but rather <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-windows-tablets\" target=\"_self\">tablets with detachable keyboards</a>. Avoid these designs unless you\u2019re looking for a part-time tablet or the lightest possible laptop.

They mostly appeal to hard-core gamers, but you can find the occasional 17-inch productivity machine or workstation if you like a larger screen for other reasons. A 17-inch or 18-inch laptop can closely mimic a desktop experience at the expense of size and weight. Most 18-inchers are meant for gaming; the larger panels complement the latest GeForce and Radeon GPUs, which use the extra chassis space for cooling. These monsters from Alienware, Asus, and Razer tackle the hardest graphics tasks to date to varying effects. </p> <p>Some of these designs can exceed 6 pounds and measure more than an inch thick.

Displays are sometimes measured in pixels per inch (ppi), but native resolution, expressed in horizontal by vertical pixels, is the most popular method.</p> <p>Most laptops have screens with at least \u201cfull HD\u201d resolutions. Also known as \u201c1080p\u201d displays, they comprise 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (or sometimes 1,920 by 1,200) and most commonly employ LCD panels built on in-plane switching (IPS) technology. IPS screen quality varies, but these screens maintain image color when viewed off-center. Thin-film transistor, or TFT, technology predates IPS and has faded out due to its inferior viewing angles.</p> <p>Only the very cheapest laptops still use TFT (resolutions of 1,280 by 720 and 1,366 by 768 pixels are common here), which cannot touch the crisp text and vivid colors found on smartphones or TVs. If you\u2019re not picky about image quality, though, a lower-resolution display might be an acceptable sacrifice.</p> <p>For the crispest text and details, common resolutions beyond 1080p include 1440p (2,560 by 1,440), 1600p (2,560 by 1,600), and 4K or 2160p (3,840 by 2,160). Some high-end screens still use IPS panels, while others use <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-oled-laptops\" target=\"_self\">OLED technology</a>. OLED screens command a premium for their inky blacks and luxurious colors. A few premium laptops have moved to mini LED backlighting technology for finer control over color depth and image brightness, especially boosting HDR content.</p> <p>Regardless of the specific screen tech, people who plan to use their laptops in brightly lit rooms or outdoors will want to make sure that the panel has a maximum brightness level of at least 500 nits.</p> <p>Finally, gamers and video content creators must pay attention to the refresh rate, or how often per second the screen redraws content, measured in hertz. A 60Hz rate is standard, with 120Hz and 144Hz common in gaming laptops and reaching as high as 360Hz. Unless you're an esports gamer seeking extreme frame rates, don't worry about going past 144Hz. And before you pay a significant premium for a high-refresh screen, be sure the graphics chip, or GPU, is muscular enough to push your games at a high enough frame rate to make a difference. A high-refresh screen won't confer many benefits if you play games at 60 frames per second or lower.</p> <p>If you want to take advantage of the touch-screen support present throughout Windows and ChromeOS, seek out a <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-touch-screen-laptops\" target=\"_self\">touch-enabled laptop</a> and perhaps even a digital stylus to write or draw on it. Some Windows laptops come in touch- and non-touch versions, so check specs carefully. Touch panels tend to be glossy screens; most matte screens designed to filter out glare from ambient lighting aren't. Most gaming laptops lack touch panels, and Apple MacBooks don't do touch screens at all.</p>"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What Is the Best Processor for Your Laptop?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>Most $1,000 ultraportables use Intel Core processors or, less commonly, AMD Ryzen CPUs. All of these offer plenty of power for everyday computing tasks, but remember that higher CPU model numbers in a given family of chips typically indicate more processor cores, higher maximum clock speeds, and sometimes even multithreading. With multithreading, each CPU core can run two sets of software instructions simultaneously instead of just one. Modern software is designed to take advantage of as many CPU cores as possible so it can run faster on multithreaded chips.</p> <p>Meanwhile, budget laptops typically use AMD Ryzen 3 processors, or Core i3 or newer Core 3 chips in Intel's case. These typically have just a few individual cores. At the other end of the spectrum, high-end\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-fastest-laptops\" target=\"_self\">powerhouse laptops</a> have <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-mobile-workstations\" target=\"_self\">workstation-class</a> Intel or AMD CPUs with double-digit core counts. However, expect to see many new Intel-based machines employing Core Ultra processors; these are the firm's successors to the Core i series, with an increased focus on AI processing.</p> <p>Regardless of which CPU a laptop has, it\u2019s typically designed to use less power and generate less heat than its desktop counterpart. In the latest mainstream, lightweight laptops, Intel laptop CPUs typically consume 15 watts (W) of power (or less) up to as much as 45W for the highest-end mobile chips.</p> <p>Gaming laptops and mobile workstations typically feature higher-powered CPUs, usually denoted by an \"H,\" \"HS,\" or \"HX\" in the CPU's model name. These require more cooling hardware and consume more energy, but they drive performance closer to that of a desktop PC. You\u2019ll find H-series CPUs from both AMD and Intel. </p> <p>Apple is in its fourth generation of M-series silicon for MacBooks. Apple's MacBook Pro laptop models contain some variation of its M4 processors. Meanwhile, you can get the basic M4 chip in the latest 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air laptops.</p> <p>Getting into laptop-processor specifics can get you pretty deep in the weeds, but for a decent overview that doesn't overwhelm you, check out <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-choose-a-laptop-cpu-in-2021\" target=\"_self\">our guide to choosing a laptop CPU</a> that fits what you do. As a rule of thumb, though, Core Ultra-family chips are Intel's latest, while the Ryzen AI 300 and Ryzen 8000 series are AMD's newest offerings. Chips with a \"U\" in the model number are typically lower-powered CPUs for thin machines, and the \"H\" chips indicate power-user machines. A newer CPU variant is the Snapdragon X Elite and Plus family from Qualcomm, powering some recent AI-equipped models that run a special Arm-based version of Windows.

You\u2019ll know you\u2019re looking at an IGP if you see a reference to Intel\u2019s Arc Graphics, HD Graphics, UHD Graphics, or Iris as the graphics solution on an Intel-CPU laptop (or Radeon Graphics on an AMD-based laptop). An IGP shares the CPU\u2019s processor cores, memory, or both. The amount of memory available to the integrated graphics chip is usually fixed, so increasing the system memory won\u2019t result in better graphics performance.</p> <p>Most gamers will want to consider a discrete GPU with dedicated graphics resources. Even a budget gaming GPU will offer an immense advantage over an integrated graphics processor when playing 3D games. Hard-core gamers should look for Nvidia\u2019s latest GeForce RTX GPUs at the high end. The very latest chips in the GeForce line are the RTX 50 series, with names like GeForce RTX 5080 and 5090.</p> <p>With gaming laptops, the level of GPU you need is deeply tied to the frame rate you want to run at the laptop\u2019s native screen resolution and the kind of games you play. That\u2019s where our reviews come in handy. We test with demanding gaming and industry-standard benchmarks to give you a relative sense of a laptop\u2019s graphics performance.

SSDs' much faster access times make them a vast improvement. They\u2019re also immune to jolts and bumps that might crash a spinning platter\u2019s heads.</p> <p>Note that not all laptop SSDs are created equal. SSDs that use the more modern, generally faster PCI Express NVMe standard, as opposed to the older, slightly slower SATA interface, are preferable. (PCI Express SSDs are rapidly taking over the field.) Either is far better than a third type, a not-quite-SSD: the much slower eMMC, a kind of flash storage drive found in budget machines. (If your budget laptop has 32GB or 64GB of storage, it's probably eMMC. Check the specs.) Traditional spinning hard drives are now rare in new laptops, and eMMC is the slowest and least desirable flash tech.\u00a0</p> <p>The minimum amount of storage space to consider is 256GB. This will accommodate operating system updates and large apps with room left over. Look for at least 512GB for multimedia storage and some PC games. You\u2019ll find 1TB or even roomier SSDs at the high end, which are increasingly required for PC gaming, but going beyond 1TB can add a lot to the overall cost. It\u2019s more cost-effective to get a 512GB or 1TB SSD and add an external drive if you need additional space.</p> <p>While a laptop\u2019s SSD stores your data, its system memory (or RAM) works with the CPU to run apps and helps define its multitasking capacity. While you might squeak by with 8GB of RAM, 16GB is essentially the floor now for RAM capacity, especially for heavy multitaskers and PC gamers. A minimum of 16GB of RAM reduces the chance of slowdown while browsing resource-hungry websites and allows you to run multiple apps at once. It's also necessary to run the various AI tasks that modern laptops can do.</p> <p>Beyond 16GB is mostly needed by content creators or high-end PC gamers; meanwhile, steer clear of anything with less than 8GB of RAM. Even Chromebooks, which are designed to demand fewer computing resources than Windows laptops, suffer from less than 8GB of RAM at a minimum.</p>"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "What Kind of Connectivity Does Your Laptop Need?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>Starting with wireless connectivity, the latest mainstream Wi-Fi standard is 802.11ax (or <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/should-you-upgrade-to-wi-fi-6\" target=\"_self\">Wi-Fi 6</a>), an important feature to look for. Steer clear of the older 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5). Today's high-end is <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-is-wi-fi-6e\" target=\"_self\">Wi-Fi 6E</a>, with the cutting-edge <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/wi-fi-7-explained-everything-to-know-about-tomorrows-fastest-wireless-spec\" target=\"_self\">Wi-Fi 7</a> showing up in mostly premium devices. The latter reduces latency and provides access to additional bandwidth with a compliant Wi-Fi 7 router.</p> <p>Serious gamers should consider a laptop with a Killer Networks setup, which more granularly prioritizes wired or wireless gaming traffic. Business users and gamers may also want a dedicated Ethernet jack. Most gaming machines will have one, and some gamers insist on wired Ethernet rules for competitive online gaming. Some leading laptops implement Ethernet as a full-size or fold-out jack; others may come with an adapter that routes Ethernet through a USB port. Others leave wired Ethernet up to you to add via an accessory.</p> <p>As for other physical connections, pay attention to a laptop's USB port type and quantity. Look for laptops with both USB Type-A and <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-usb-c-an-explainer\" target=\"_self\">Type-C ports</a>. USB-A is the familiar rectangular connector that has been around for decades, while USB-C is smaller, pill-shaped, and sometimes accepts the laptop\u2019s charger.</p> <p>Some budget laptops may only have USB-A ports. On the other hand, some ultra-thin designs only have USB-C ports, so you\u2019ll need dongles to connect USB-A peripherals you own. A mix is what you want.</p> <p>Check for an HDMI or DisplayPort connector for video output, especially if you plan to connect your laptop to your TV, desktop monitor, or lecture hall A/V system. DisplayPort video outputs are sometimes implemented on laptops via USB-C ports to save space.</p> <p>Photographers may benefit from a built-in SD or microSD card reader for image uploading. Finally, if you plan to use your laptop in an unsecured location, a Kensington-cable style or a Noble-lock style security notch for fastening a physical locking cable is helpful. Make sure the notch type matches the kind of tethering cable you intend to use.</p>"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are Refurbished Laptops Worth Buying?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>Every manufacturer and reseller has different standards for refurbishing used laptops. It is best to buy any refurbished machine directly from the manufacturer\u2019s online store rather than a reseller.</p> <p>Some resellers or third parties will rate their refurbished stock with a grade. (It pays to ask who has done the refurbishing\u2014the manufacturer or the reseller.) Refurbished laptops are sold and rated with grades of A, B+, B, C, and so on to reflect their wear and tear. However, it\u2019s generally up to the reseller what the grade means. We strongly recommend insisting on an ironclad return policy in the case of purchases like these if you decide to roll the dice. You could end up pleasantly surprised, but usually, a refurbished laptop deal that looks too good to be true...is.</p>"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Should You Get a Longer Laptop Warranty?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>Most laptop makers offer one-year warranties on parts and labor. These standard plans are limited, so they won't cover accidents like spilling a drink on the keyboard or dropping the system on the sidewalk. Fortunately, your credit card issuer likely covers such mishaps for a short period after you buy a new product, and it also may extend the manufacturer's warranty. (For example, many Mastercard accounts include a doubling of the standard warranty period up to one year.) Check your account benefits guide for details.</p> <p>If your credit card issuer doesn\u2019t cover you, some top laptop makers will happily sell you extended warranties. Apple, Dell, HP, and Lenovo all offer a wide range of extended warranties and coverage for accidental damage. Expect to spend $100 to $300 for these options. Our rule of thumb is that if a warranty costs more than 15% of the laptop's purchase price, you're better off spending the money on backup drives or services that minimize downtime.</p> <p>Of course, you can't put a price tag on peace of mind. You'll encounter instances when the logic board or the display\u2014the most expensive parts of a laptop\u2014fail, and while rare, such a catastrophe can cost you half of what the laptop is worth in repair costs.</p>"}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Ready to Buy the Right Laptop for You?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "<p>Shopping for a leading laptop is an exercise in patience.
