If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nWhat to consider\n\niOS or Android\n\nIf your family and friends are on Apple services like iMessage and FaceTime, stick with an iPhone. If you\u2019ve been deep on Samsung, stay on Android. Know that switching between the two has never been easier.\n\nSize\n\nPhones are large in general with the smallest ones having a 6.1-inch screen and large models topping out at 6.8 inches. That makes visiting a store and trying a phone out before you buy it quite important.\n\nCameras\n\nPhone cameras have gotten better over the past five years. Don\u2019t be fooled by how many cameras a phone has; more is not necessarily better.\n\nSoftware support\n\nPhone makers promise varying lengths of long-term software and security support ranging from just one year to as many as seven. These updates not only ensure you get many of the latest features but also keep your phone secure.\n\nvs\n\nFrom Apple's  iPhone Air  and  iPhone 17 family  to  Samsung's Galaxy S25 series  and foldable phones like the  Motorola Razr Ultra  and  Galaxy Z Fold 7 , the best phones in 2025 have a battery life that lasts a day or more, cameras that  take stunning photos  and vibrant displays. We test dozens of phones each year, but only consider a few to be truly great. This list has the best phones we think are worth buying. Plus, we recently tested and added Apple's new iPhone 17 line, including the new  iPhone 17 , thin  iPhone Air  and the  iPhone 17 Pro .\n\nThe best phone for most people is the  iPhone 17 . It shares many features with Apple's pricier 17 Pro models, but at a lower $829 starting price (or $799 if you activate through a carrier). It supports the newest camera capabilities such as Dual Capture and Center Stage selfies, and has a 1-120Hz variable refresh rate for smoother scrolling and support for its always-on display.\n\nWhile it's true that the iPhone 17 shares a striking resemblance to last year's iPhone 16, some key updates help it stand out. Apart from the upgraded refresh rate, the iPhone 17 also boasts a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, along with an anti-reflective display that makes it easier to see the screen outdoors.\u00a0A Ceramic Shield 2 display offers three times better scratch resistance, according to Apple, so if you're susceptible to etching into your screen, it has a little more protection now. The iPhone 17 starts with a higher 256GB storage option, as opposed to the 128GB starting point on the iPhone 16, meaning you get more bang for your buck.\n\nThe ultrawide camera goes from 12 megapixels on the iPhone 16 to 48 megapixels on the iPhone 17, and Apple says the iPhone 17 has up to eight hours more of video playback. Indeed, in CNET's three-hour streaming test, the iPhone 17's battery dropped from 100% to 89%, while the iPhone 16 hit 86%.\n\nThe iPhone 17 also has all the new  iOS 26  capabilities, such as Live Translation, Call Screening and the new Liquid Glass interface. Unlike previous iPhone generations, the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro models share almost all the same hardware features, apart from the telephoto lens and bigger battery on the latter. While Apple tends to introduce features like the Dynamic Island and Action button on Pro models first, the two ends of the iPhone spectrum now pack all those same hardware functions.\n\nWith the iPhone 17, Apple has significantly narrowed the chasm separating its baseline model from its Pro counterparts. The $829 iPhone 17 (or $799 if you activate with a carrier) shares many of the same camera features with the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, like Dual Capture and Center Stage. It also finally gets a display with a 1-120Hz variable refresh rate, so you can enjoy smoother scrolling and enable the always-on display and see your notifications at a glance. And support for iOS 26 across the full iPhone 17 lineup means you can access Apple's most talked-about new software features like live translation, call screening and the Liquid Glass redesign. All that without spending upwards of $1,100 for a Pro model, albeit with slightly scaled-back battery life and cameras.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe iPhone 17 is a baseline phone that shares many hardware and software features with the iPhone 17 Pro models, making it feel like a worthy, money-saving contender to those pricier devices. Generous battery life, faster charging and camera upgrades help it stand apart from last year's iPhone 16, even if it looks almost identical.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nThe iPhone 17 is a great choice for the average phone user who wants good cameras, solid battery life and a quality display. It's also a good size for anyone who doesn't like larger phones.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nIf you're a photography enthusiast and a particularly heavy phone user, the 17 Pros might be the way to go, since you'll get a telephoto lens on the back, as well as longer battery life. On the other hand, if you're a lighter phone user, you can save more money by opting for the slightly more budget-friendly $599  iPhone 16E .\n\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 is our top-pick for Android phones. The Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and  S25 Ultra  \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across  all  of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom  Snapdragon 8 Elite  processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\n\nAnd while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the  S24  and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life.  Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review .\n\nWhy we like it\n\nHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely  other options  for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.\n\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\n\nYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.\n\nWhile the cosmic orange color gets all the attention, the iPhone 17 Pro looks dapper in dark blue. Curiously, there isn't a black or space grey version of the Pro.\n\nFrom the first moment I picked up the new $1,199 iPhone 17 Pro Max and $1,099 17 Pro, I was beguiled by their bold, bright redesign. It's a complete turnaround from the years of Apple's subdued titanium motif. The square camera bump of previous Pro models is now a body-wide bar that Apple calls the \"camera plateau.\" The 17 Pro and Pro Max now come in actual colors -- you won't find one in black or space gray. This phone, especially in cosmic orange, wants you to look at it.\n\nAs I tested the new Pro phones, I was consistently impressed: Even after a full day of heavy use, the Pro Max's battery still had 22% or more left. The iPhone 17 Pro Max has the best battery life of any phone that CNET has ever tested.\n\nThe 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max have the exact same rear cameras, all with 48-megapixel sensors. You can choose between the trio of lenses (wide-angle, ultrawide and telephoto) to capture photos at 12-, 24- or 48-megapixel resolutions. The telephoto camera has gone from the 16 Pro's 12-megapixel sensor with a 5x lens to a 48-megapixel sensor that's 56% larger with a new 4x telephoto lens. You read that right: The new Pro has a shorter optical zoom than its predecessor. But I find the short 4x zoom better for portraits, and the increase in detail and dynamic range in 4x photos is a big improvement over 5x snaps from the 16 Pro.\n\nThere's a new selfie camera on both Pro phones that Apple calls Center Stage. It not only takes 18-megapixel selfies, up from 12 megapixels on the 16 Pro, but you can hold the 17 Pro vertically and take a horizontal selfie thanks to a new square image sensor.\n\nI can't help but contrast the iPhone 17 Pro models to Apple's newest phone. The iPhone Air is thin, light, quiet and graceful -- with a single rear camera, shorter battery life and $100 cheaper starting price. The 17 Pro and Pro Max are bold, loud, aggressive and powerful, and their daring design appeals to me. But features such as its amazing battery life, brighter screen, new selfie camera and iOS 26 are the real reasons to get either.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nI appreciate that Apple gave the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max personality. Gone is the minimal design for the sake of simplicity. We have a phone that is more durable, has a longer battery life, and, when running iOS 26, comes with a number of significant \"quality of life\" improvements, like live translations for calls, texts and FaceTime.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max would be an excellent upgrade for someone coming from an iPhone 14 Pro or older. You get a bigger battery, a better screen, faster charging, newer cameras and a speedier processor that can handle graphics-intensive games and Apple Intelligence.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nIf you have an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, you don't need these new phones unless battery capacity on your current phone is low -- and even then, it'd be cheaper to simply have your battery swapped out. And unless you have a gracious disposable income, iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max owners can sit this one out.\n\nRead our iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max review .\n\nMoto AI is a hub for integrated services like Perplexity, Gemini and Copilot.\n\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra is a beefed-up version of last year's  Razr Plus , which won a  CNET Editor's Choice Award . It's as if the Razr Plus hired a trainer and nutritionist and then got absolutely ripped -- warranting its name: Ultra. After testing, I've come to adore the Razr Ultra. It does all the \"normal\" non-folding phone things I want, and offers me a truly unique experience thanks to its cover screen. I feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed.\n\nBut in taking nearly every aspect of the phone to the extreme, Motorola lost one of the most important parts of recent Razrs: the amazing value. The catch for all this ultra-ness: the Motorola Razr Ultra costs $1,300.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThis is the best built foldable flip phone I've ever used. Motorola took the best parts of the Razr Plus and improved nearly everything else. The battery life is outstanding and easily lasts a day on a single charge and can get you mostly through a second day even. The displays are brighter. The main 7-inch foldable display is larger and has more resolution than the Razr Plus and the cameras are improved. The fabric backing is delightful.\n\nWho's it best for Someone who wants a fun, unique an robust foldable phone. You're willing to pay top-dollar to get the best processor, battery, design and cameras Motorola has ever made.\n\nWho shouldn't get it If you're unsure of foldables, this might not be the best fit. If you find yourself in places with sand, dirt and other fine particles, the Razr Ultra (like all foldable phones) isn't worth the risk. The Razr Ultra has the same class-leading IP-rating for dust and water resistance, but the dust resistance is only for particles 1-mm or larger.\n\nWith the  Galaxy Z Fold 7 , Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\n\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\n\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll  rarely need to open the phone  -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the  Galaxy S25 Ultra  might be a better fit.\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL aren't a revolution over their predecessors, but almost every element from the software to the hardware has seen some kind of update, resulting in a phone that feels fresh but familiar. The processor isn't the fastest around, but it's got more than enough power for anything you're likely to need it for, while the cameras have proven themselves extremely capable in our testing.\n\nMix in the fun (and potentially quite useful) new AI skills and the long software support period and Google's new phones do a lot to earn their \"flagship\" title.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL build on their already superb predecessors, offering more power and deeper, more useful AI skills. The cameras remain some of the best around while the large 6.8-inch display offers plenty of space to do justice to YouTube videos and mobile games on the go.\n\nWho it's best for\n\nWhile some Android rivals offer more straight-line speed, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL offer a truly slick all-around experience. These phones are easy to use, swift to operate and allow you to take stunning images with little input on your part. If you want a \"do it all\" phone that won't get in your way, you'll likely do well these phones.\n\nWho shouldn't get it\n\nPassionate mobile gamers wanting to hit the highest frame rates for pro-level mobile gaming may find the Tensor G5 processor's raw speed lacking.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag. If you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering.  Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review .\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\n\nWho's it best for\n\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\n\nWho shouldn\u2019t get i t\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\n\nFor $499, Google's Pixel 9A truly feels like you're getting more bang for your buck. It comes with several significant upgrades from last year's  Pixel 8A : a fresh design, new display, larger battery, slightly more powerful chip, increased durability and upgraded software features.\n\nBut don't get me wrong -- it's not a perfect phone. There are places where Google had to compromise to keep the price under $500, like the lack of satellite connectivity for emergencies available on the  $799 Pixel 9 . Overall, though, I think the compromises Google made were smart and that the Pixel 9A is worth every penny.  Read our Google Pixel 9A review .\n\nWhy we like it The Pixel 9A is proof that you don't need to spend more than $500 to get a great phone. It can handle all you daily tasks from scrolling social media and news feeds and swiping through TikTok videos to taking a beautiful photo and lasting a day on a single charge.\n\nWho's it best for? In theory: anybody. The Pixel 9A is for anyone who wants 95% of what a $1,000 phone can do at half the price.\n\nWho shouldn't get it Anyone who wants the absolute fastest processor or the most cutting edge cameras.\n\nWhen we tested the  iPhone 16 and 16 Plus,  we were definitely impressed by the photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. And while we think the iPhone 17 is quite the deal, you can still snag the iPhone 16 for $100 less. We consider the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\n\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\n\nWhy we like it\n\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because they appeal to novice users and power players. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of t", "excerpt": "We tested the best phones -- from Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Google\u2019s Pixel 10 to Apple's iPhone Air and iPhone 17 -- and updated our top picks.\n\nCNET staff -- not advertisers, partners or business interests -- determine how we review products and services.

The Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.&nbsp;And while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.Why we like itHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800. Who it's best forIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.Who shouldn\u2019t get itYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.", "offers": [{"@type": "Offer", "price": "800", "priceCurrency": "USD", "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock", "url": "https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=0JlRymcP1YU&mid=47773&u1=subid_value&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s25%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-s25-128gb-unlocked-sm-s931udbaxaa%2F", "offeredBy": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Samsung"}}]}}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 3, "item": {"@type": "Product", "name": "iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max", "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/cc2f820def76d5894a6d80ac6eb3bd2be43a2113/hub/2025/09/17/d445d3d6-8270-4698-8887-c60d67f3aa77/opening-edited-bokeh-00-00-56-04-still002-3.jpg?auto=webp&height=500", "description": "From the first moment I picked up the new $1,199 iPhone 17 Pro Max and $1,099 17 Pro, I was beguiled by their bold, bright redesign. It's a complete turnaround from the years of Apple's subdued titanium motif. The square camera bump of previous Pro models is now a body-wide bar that Apple calls the \"camera plateau.\" The 17 Pro and Pro Max now come in actual colors -- you won't find one in black or space gray. This phone, especially in cosmic orange, wants you to look at it.As I tested the new Pro phones, I was consistently impressed: Even after a full day of heavy use, the Pro Max's battery still had 22% or more left. The iPhone 17 Pro Max has the best battery life of any phone that CNET has ever tested.The 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max have the exact same rear cameras, all with 48-megapixel sensors. You can choose between the trio of lenses (wide-angle, ultrawide and telephoto) to capture photos at 12-, 24- or 48-megapixel resolutions. The telephoto camera has gone from the 16 Pro's 12-megapixel sensor with a 5x lens to a 48-megapixel sensor that's 56% larger with a new 4x telephoto lens. You read that right: The new Pro has a shorter optical zoom than its predecessor. But I find the short 4x zoom better for portraits, and the increase in detail and dynamic range in 4x photos is a big improvement over 5x snaps from the 16 Pro.There's a new selfie camera on both Pro phones that Apple calls Center Stage. It not only takes 18-megapixel selfies, up from 12 megapixels on the 16 Pro, but you can hold the 17 Pro vertically and take a horizontal selfie thanks to a new square image sensor.I can't help but contrast the iPhone 17 Pro models to Apple's newest phone. The iPhone Air is thin, light, quiet and graceful -- with a single rear camera, shorter battery life and $100 cheaper starting price. The 17 Pro and Pro Max are bold, loud, aggressive and powerful, and their daring design appeals to me. But features such as its amazing battery life, brighter screen, new selfie camera and iOS 26 are the real reasons to get either.Why we like itI appreciate that Apple gave the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max personality. Gone is the minimal design for the sake of simplicity. We have a phone that is more durable, has a longer battery life, and, when running iOS 26, comes with a number of significant \"quality of life\" improvements, like live translations for calls, texts and FaceTime.Who it's best forThe iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max would be an excellent upgrade for someone coming from an iPhone 14 Pro or older. You get a bigger battery, a better screen, faster charging, newer cameras and a speedier processor that can handle graphics-intensive games and Apple Intelligence.Who shouldn't get itIf you have an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, you don't need these new phones unless battery capacity on your current phone is low -- and even then, it'd be cheaper to simply have your battery swapped out. And unless you have a gracious disposable income, iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max owners can sit this one out.Read our iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max review.", "offers": [{"@type": "Offer", "price": "1099", "priceCurrency": "USD", "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock", "url": "https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=cnet&partnerpropertyid=235399&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-17-pro&subId1=subid_value", "offeredBy": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Apple"}}, {"@type": "Offer", "price": "1099", "priceCurrency": "USD", "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock", "url": "https://cc.cnet.com/v1/otc/04Yxjj1rHOmYAxbnVDhvKNn?merchant=07ceq7iAfFfRlRYt8DCvPYM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fapple-iphone-17-pro-256gb-cosmic-orange-at-t%2FJCQ6HHJ56R", "offeredBy": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Best Buy"}}]}}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 4, "item": {"@type": "Product", "name": "Motorola Razr Ultra", "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/2826b1246c7ef1af23c4046c5481632dfa3d3377/hub/2025/05/14/5533e64d-b242-4934-86fc-ccb89f0b855c/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-7526.jpg?auto=webp&height=500", "description": "The Motorola Razr Ultra is a beefed-up version of last year's Razr Plus, which won a CNET Editor's Choice Award. It's as if the Razr Plus hired a trainer and nutritionist and then got absolutely ripped -- warranting its name: Ultra. After testing, I've come to adore the Razr Ultra. It does all the \"normal\" non-folding phone things I want, and offers me a truly unique experience thanks to its cover screen. I feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed. But in taking nearly every aspect of the phone to the extreme, Motorola lost one of the most important parts of recent Razrs: the amazing value. The catch for all this ultra-ness: the Motorola Razr Ultra costs $1,300.Why we like itThis is the best built foldable flip phone I've ever used. Motorola took the best parts of the Razr Plus and improved nearly everything else. The battery life is outstanding and easily lasts a day on a single charge and can get you mostly through a second day even. The displays are brighter. The main 7-inch foldable display is larger and has more resolution than the Razr Plus and the cameras are improved. The fabric backing is delightful.Who's it best forSomeone who wants a fun, unique an robust foldable phone. You're willing to pay top-dollar to get the best processor, battery, design and cameras Motorola has ever made.Who shouldn't get itIf you're unsure of foldables, this might not be the best fit.

The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.&nbsp;Altogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.Why we like itThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.&nbsp;Thankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.&nbsp;Who it's best forIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.&nbsp;Who shouldn't get itThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge.

But as I tested the new clamshell phone, I became enthralled by its inner screen. At 6.9 inches, this is the biggest screen on any Samsung phone aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has an 8-inch foldable display.&nbsp;The Z Flip 7's large screen size makes content feel more immersive and colors look lovely and vivid. This led to epic TikTok and Instagram sessions, watching widescreen films such as A Working Man and Back to the Future, as well as jumping back and forth between two apps stacked vertically on the screen thanks to One UI 8's 90:10 split tool.Every time I open the Flip 7, I'm consistently dumbfounded by how such a large display can unfurl from something about the size of a makeup compact. And when it's closed, there's a 4.1-inch cover screen that's fantastic in its own ways, with new clever animations for when you're recording a video, charging the phone or taking a selfie, all efficiently using the extra display real estate. In terms of functionality, though, the cover screen's software is about the same as the 3.4-inch one on the Flip 6.The Flip 7 impressed me in nearly every way but one: its battery life. It has a larger battery than the Flip 6, but it doesn't last any longer in daily use. It did consistently get me through a day on a single charge, often having 15 to 20% left, but there were also a few days where it needed an early evening top-off.Why we like itThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the most fully realized version of Samsung's ideal of a flip phone since the launch of the original Galaxy Z Flip in 2020. The Flip 7's appeal is simple: It's a thin phone with a big, bold screen that folds in half into a coaster-sized square. The larger cover screen and inner screen make content more immersive. It's design is thin (for a clamshell foldable) and comfortable to hold. Plus you get twice the storage this year compared to last.Who is it best forIf you've been tempted by a clamshell-style foldable, you should definitely consider the Flip 7. If you have a Galaxy Z Flip 4 or older, the Flip 7 will be an upgrade in every way. It's harder to make that same recommendation for Flip 5 owners unless your phone is showing its age. And if you have a Galaxy Z Flip 6, you can sit this one out unless you really want those larger screens.&nbsp;Who shouldn\u2019t get itIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.", "offers": [{"@type": "Offer", "price": "$1,100", "priceCurrency": "USD", "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock", "url": "https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=0JlRymcP1YU&mid=47773&u1=subid_value&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-z-flip7%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-z-flip7-256gb-unlocked-sku-sm-f766udbaxaa%2F", "offeredBy": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Samsung"}}, {"@type": "Offer", "price": "$950", "priceCurrency": "USD", "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock", "url": "https://cc.cnet.com/v1/otc/04Yxjj1rHOmYAxbnVDhvKNn?merchant=07ceq7iAfFfRlRYt8DCvPYM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip7-512gb-unlocked-blue-shadow%2F6635716.p%3FskuId%3D6635716", "offeredBy": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Best Buy"}}]}}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 11, "item": {"@type": "Product", "name": "Google Pixel 10", "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/507e5bc63c20e78f259ddd17e8659c09e4a2aeff/hub/2025/08/27/faee82a2-bb73-4623-be94-4ddbfa8202ca/p1007951.jpg?auto=webp&height=500", "description": "At $799, the Pixel 10 is a baseline device that packs many of the same features that help Pro-level phones stand out, like a telephoto camera, long-lasting battery and intuitive AI features.

But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny.

In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.Who it's best forIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.Who shouldn\u2019t get itIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus.
