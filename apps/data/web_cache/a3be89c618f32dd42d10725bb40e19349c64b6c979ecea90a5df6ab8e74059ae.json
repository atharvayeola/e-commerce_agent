He has tested 160 phones over 16 years.\n\nIt's the final Prime Day of the year! See all of the  (actually good) deals  our experts have spotted so far.\n\nPlus: Sign up for  Wirecutter\u2019s daily newsletter  to get handpicked deals straight to your inbox.\n\nThere\u2019s no one smartphone that is best for everyone, but we\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours testing scores of phones so that you can find the best one for you. The phone you buy will depend on your budget,  your wireless carrier , and which of the major smartphone platforms\u2014Apple\u2019s iOS or Google\u2019s Android\u2014you\u2019re already invested in. But whether you want a top-of-the-line phone or something more affordable, we have recommendations for iPhone and Android, and all of our picks are available for all the major US carriers.\n\nThe iPhone 16 has a fast processor for better gaming performance and AI features (though those are pretty underwhelming so far). It also gains the customizable Action button that was reserved for the Pro models last year, a Camera Control button for quickly taking photos, all-day battery life with fast charging, and a redesigned rear camera system with a new ultrawide lens for shooting detailed macro photos.\n\nIf you want a larger phone, the iPhone 16 Plus has all of the same features as the iPhone 16, but with a bigger screen and longer battery life.\n\nWho it\u2019s for:  The iPhone 16 is ideal for someone who wants a bright screen, a fast processor for Pro-level gaming and performance, all-day battery life with fast-charging, and great cameras for shooting photos and videos. The iPhone 16 Plus is ideal for those who prefer a larger screen and lengthy battery life, without paying more for the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\nWhy we like them:  The  Apple iPhone 16 \u00a0provides Pro-level features with powerful performance. Its overall design remains unchanged: The iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch display, and the 16 Plus has a 6.7-inch screen, both of which can reach up to 2,000 nits of maximum outdoor brightness and can dim as low as 1 nit to preserve battery life. But it comes in vibrant new color options, including teal and pink.\n\nThe 16 also has two side buttons: the customizable Action button from the iPhone 15 Pro lineup, which lets you quickly trigger tasks like Focus Mode or turning your ringer off, and a Camera Control button, which launches the Camera app, as well as cycles through select camera settings. (The Camera Control is a little finicky, so we don\u2019t recommend upgrading just for that.) The iPhone 16\u2019s rear dual-lens camera setup is now vertically stacked with a wide-angle lens that can capture macro photos.\n\nBoth are powered by Apple\u2019s custom A18 chip, which feels noticeably faster than the iPhone 15 for multitasking, speech recognition, and image and video processing. It can also handle Pro-level gaming with more realistic visual effects and lighting, as well as Apple\u2019s AI features, which start rolling out next month. The new chip is also power-efficient, which helps the iPhone 16 last longer than the previous model. The  iPhone 16 Plus  offers the same features as the iPhone 16 but adds a larger battery, and MagSafe charging is now faster across all iPhone 16 models.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers:  Apple's much-hyped AI features weren\u2019t available at launch. While they\u2019ve since rolled out in waves over the past nine months, they\u2019re not compelling enough to be the sole reason for upgrading. The AI features, which include a photo cleanup tool that removes unwanted people or objects from photos and writing tools to make emails and texts sound more professional, are useful, but they\u2019re not the smarter Siri that Apple promised.\n\nTo see if the iPhone 16 is right for you, read  our full guide to which iPhone you should get .\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro has a larger screen and a powerful chip that promises to enable useful AI features (but they\u2019re not all that useful yet). New camera features and excellent battery life make the iPhone 16 Pro a worthy upgrade.\n\nFor an even bigger screen and the longest-lasting iPhone battery, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an excellent iPhone \u2014 but it\u2019ll cost you.\n\nWho it\u2019s for:  Those who prefer larger screens, the best cameras for photos and videos, and flagship-level performance and battery will like the iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is for those who want everything the 16 Pro offers but with an even bigger display and a longer-lasting battery.\n\nWhy we like them:  The  Apple iPhone 16 Pro  and  iPhone 16 Pro Max \u00a0both have larger screens than previous models at 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, respectively. The always-on screens are otherwise the same as previous models, with a 120 Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 2,000 nits, though they can now dim as low as 1 nit to preserve battery life.\n\nBoth Pro models are powered by Apple\u2019s custom A18 Pro processor, which feels marginally faster than last year\u2019s Pro phones. The new chip powers new camera features, upcoming AI features, and offers improved graphics and overall performance for high-end games. The new chip is also more power-efficient, which gives the Pro models longer battery life. The iPhone 16 Pro Max now offers the best battery life of any iPhone.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models share the same triple-lens rear camera systems with a 48-megapixel main lens, a 48-megapixel ultrawide, and a 12-megapixel telephoto with 5x optical zoom (the iPhone 15 Pro was limited to a 3x zoom, while the 15 Pro Max offered 5x). The triple- camera setup provides a total of seven focal lengths: 13 mm macro, 13 mm ultra-wide, 24 mm, 28 mm, 35 mm, 48 mm 2x telephoto, or 120 mm 5x telephoto. The main camera can capture excellent photos in normal conditions with accurate colors and sharp details, but it also excels in night-mode shots, portrait shots, night-mode portraits, and selfies. The ultrawide sensor provides better resolution for both wide-angle photos and sharper macro photos. The 5x telephoto sensor keeps the details sharp in well-lit and low-light situations. The Pro models can also now record in 4K 120 fps video, which lets you shoot beautiful, high-quality slow-motion and can adjust the speed and frame rate when editing.\n\nThe Pro models added four new microphones to capture clearer voice audio recordings, which combined with the Audio Mix feature (exclusive to iPhone 16 models), uses AI and mics to filter out unwanted background noise and isolate vocals on an audio track. This feature is also on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models, but the Pro\u2019s new mics give it an edge.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers:  The 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max was already on the larger side for those with small hands, pockets, and bags, and the 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max is even larger and heavier. The 6.3-inch 16 Pro hits the sweet spot\u2014not too big or too small\u2014and saves you $200, but with shorter battery life.\n\nIf neither the iPhone 16 or 16 Pro sounds right for you, or if you\u2019d just like to know more about the full range of iPhones that Apple currently sells, read  our full guide to which iPhone you should get .\n\nThe iPhone 16e is on the pricier side for a \u201cbudget\u201d phone, especially compared with the discontinued iPhone SE. But with the higher price comes a more premium build, long battery life, an efficient camera, and excellent performance.\n\nWho it\u2019s for:  The  iPhone 16e  is a great option for anyone who wants a reliable iPhone at a more affordable price. It delivers powerful performance, a capable camera, and long-lasting battery life.\n\nWhy we like it:  The iPhone 16e has a lot to offer, even as a budget model. It feels more premium than its predecessor, the third-gen iPhone SE. It has an aluminum frame, a matte-glass back, and a Face ID notch in place of Touch ID. The aesthetic aligns more closely with that of a newer iPhone. The larger, 6.1-inch display also has a minimal bezel that essentially makes the iPhone 16e look as if it\u2019s almost all screen. With a peak brightness of 1,200 nits, it also gets plenty bright. It\u2019s almost as bright as the iPhone 16\u2019s 1,600-nit peak; when we placed the two phones side by side, we could hardly tell the difference.\n\nIt has excellent battery life, too, thanks to its larger battery and custom C1 modem (which is more power-efficient), plus the latest A18 chip. We managed to squeeze out 36 hours on a single charge, even with extremely heavy usage. You\u2019re certain to notice a difference if you\u2019re upgrading from an older iPhone or one of the more recent iPhone mini models, but the 16e also surpasses the more expensive iPhone 16 in battery life.\n\nThe 16e has a USB-C port, which supports fast charging with a 20 W USB-C adapter. In our testing, the iPhone 16e went from fully dead to 47% in 30 minutes. You can also charge it wirelessly with a Qi-compatible charging pad, but in that case it has a maximum speed of 7.5 W, so it will charge more slowly.\n\nAlthough this is Apple\u2019s cheapest phone, it supports Apple Intelligence. The suite of artificial intelligence features includes various writing and photo-editing tools, AI-generated emoji, and more. More features will continue to roll out in the future. AI is not a reason to buy this phone, but it\u2019s nice to know that the 16e is future-proofed with support for Apple\u2019s more advanced features.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers:  The iPhone 16e is more expensive than the third-generation iPhone SE, as Apple increased the price by $170. Despite its additional features, we would have preferred a slightly lower price for a \u201cbudget\u201d phone.\n\nThe photos could be better, as well. The single, 48-megapixel rear camera lens delivers good shots. But don\u2019t expect the same higher-quality images you\u2019d get from the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro, which have double- and triple-camera systems, respectively. And although the iPhone 16e supports wireless charging, it isn\u2019t compatible with Apple\u2019s MagSafe technology, so you can\u2019t attach magnetic accessories to the back of the phone.\n\nTo see if the iPhone 16e is right for you, read  our full guide to which iPhone you should get .\n\nThe Pixel 9 offers a bright OLED screen, a fast new processor, useful AI features, all-day battery life, and one of the best cameras on a smartphone. It also promises security updates until fall 2031.\n\nWho it\u2019s for:  The Pixel 9 is the best choice for people who want a fast, secure Android phone with premium hardware, a bright screen, a great camera, and guaranteed software updates but don\u2019t want to spend a thousand dollars.\n\nWhy we like it:  The  Google Pixel 9  got a redesign and looks more like a flagship phone (or, some would say, an iPhone), with rounded corners, flat sides, a soft-touch matte back, and a matte metal finish. The Pixel 9 has a 6.32-inch 120 Hz OLED screen that stretches nearly edge to edge with minimal borders. That slightly bigger new screen can now reach up to 2,700 nits, so it\u2019s extremely bright for outdoor use, and it also has an extra-dim feature that makes the screen easier on the eyes in dark rooms.\n\nThe Pixel 9 also has Google\u2019s new Tensor 4 chip plus 12 GB of RAM to support more on-device AI features, high-quality software, and the same camera features that have made all of Google\u2019s Pixel phones great. This phone comes with Google\u2019s clean, responsive version of Android 14, and it\u2019s guaranteed to get seven years of updates through fall 2031. The Pixel 9 has a dual-camera setup\u2014with a sharp 50-megapixel main sensor and an upgraded 48-megapixel ultrawide sensor\u2014that allows it to take better photos than almost any other Android phone (except the higher-end Pixels).\n\nThough it has only two camera lenses, the Pixel 9\u2019s photo processing is borderline magical. It offers new photo features such as Add Me, which uses a combination of AI and AR to take group photos without a tripod or someone else shooting photos, and Reimagine, which allows you to manipulate photos by adding fireworks or mountains, say, or changing colors using Google\u2019s Magic Editor software. The Pixel 9 also includes our favorite Pixel 8 features: Best Take, which lets you create a composite photo from multiple pics to grab the best faces from your subjects, Magic Eraser, which can remove distractions and unwanted background objects in photos, Audio Magic Eraser, which removes unwanted noise from your videos, Call Screen, which tells you who\u2019s calling you and what they want before you pick up, and assistive features such as Guided Frame and the Magnifier app for people who are blind or have low vision.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers:  Pixel models aren\u2019t the value smartphones they once were\u2014the Pixel 9 is $100 more expensive than last year\u2019s models. The $800 Pixel 9 is now the same price as the base-model iPhone 15 and Samsung Galaxy S24. For context, the Pixel 7 was $600 when it went on sale just two years ago.\n\nTo read more about the Pixel 9 and other Android phones we\u2019ve tested, read  our full guide to the best Android phones .\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is the same size as the Pixel 9 but offers a brighter screen, improved cameras, and more AI features.\n\nWho it\u2019s for:  People who want a bigger phone that captures the best images will like the Pixel 9 Pro.\n\nWhy we like it:  The  Pixel 9 Pro  is a higher-end version of the Pixel 9, adding a brighter 6.3-inch OLED display, a polished metal finish, a longer-lasting battery, a 5x-optical-zoom lens, professional camera controls, better video quality, and support for Google\u2019s AI-powered Gemini Advanced features.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is one of the fastest phones you can buy. Scrolling and navigating apps is exceptionally smooth, and certain functions, such as Gemini and Google Assistant responses, are much faster than on other phones thanks to Google\u2019s Tensor 4 processor and the Pro\u2019s 16 GB of RAM. The new screen is even brighter than that of the Pixel 9, capable of up to 3,000 nits of maximum outdoor brightness.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is also an upgrade over the Pixel 9 in that it has an additional camera lens: It has a third, 48-megapixel lens on the back with a 5x zoom that retains detail even when fully zoomed in. It takes the best photos of any Android phone we\u2019ve tested, and you don\u2019t have to tinker with the settings to get stunning images, though the Pixel 9 Pro offers manual controls to adjust things such as white balance, focus, shutter speed, and ISO if you want more granular control of your photos. It can also utilize the full-resolution 50-megapixel main camera instead of relying on a compressed 12-megapixel image. The Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s Super Res Zoom makes photos zoomed in from 5x to 20x zoom look clearer with more visible details. And the Pro has a better selfie camera than the Pixel 9\u201442 megapixels versus the lower-priced Pixel\u2019s 10.5-megapixel sensor\u2014which makes your selfies as nearly as good as photos you take on the rear-facing cameras.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has 16 GB of RAM to power an on-device, advanced version of Google\u2019s Gemini Assistant, which analyzes images, speech, and text in addition to answering queries, supporting voice typing, and handling all of the other features Google Assistant offers. It also includes access to Gemini Live, Google\u2019s new conversation-based assistant, which lets you ask questions just as you would type them into a Google search. Pixel 9 Pro owners get one year of Gemini Advanced for free (which usually costs $239 a year), and that also includes 2\u00a0TB of Google One cloud storage and access to Gemini AI within apps like Gmail and Google Docs.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers:  The Google Pixel 9 Pro has the Pixel 8 Pro\u2019s gimmicky temperature sensor, which we find useless. But you don\u2019t have to use it.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s Video Boost feature, which requires you to upload your videos to the cloud via Google Photos to improve your video details, colors, and stabilization, is tricky to use, because it requires you to turn the option on before pressing record. It also requires you to upload your video files to the cloud via Google Photos for processing instead of letting it happen on your device. The entire process can take several hours to complete\u2014and if you\u2019re shooting in 8K, even longer.\n\nFor more information on the Google Pixel 9 Pro, read  our full guide to the best Android phones .\n\nThe Moto G Power feels more like a flagship phone than its low price would have you believe, and the battery lasted nearly two days in our tests.\n\nYou save $83 (29%)\n\nWho it\u2019s for:  If you want a smooth, simple experience, a long battery life, and a big screen on a budget, the Moto G Power is a great fit.\n\nWhy we like it:  Normally priced around $300, the  Moto G Power  feels like a much more expensive device. The screen is large and bright, scrolling through apps and opening multiple windows feels smooth, and the gaming performance is lag-free. The battery lasted through two days of fairly heavy use in our tests, and the speakers sounded decent, not tinny or harsh like those of many other budget phones. It also has fun built-in features, such as an FM radio that you can use with wired headphones.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers:  Though the battery will last a long time, it takes a similarly long time to charge. In addition, this phone will receive only three years\u2019 worth of security updates, with support ending in 2028.\n\nFor more information on the Moto G Power (2025), read  our full guide to the best budget Android phones .\n\nThis article was edited by Caitlin McGarry.\n\nRoderick Scott\n\nRoderick Scott was Wirecutter's staff writer reporting on smartphones, tablets, and accessories.
