Why trust us?\n\nNavigating the sea of smartphones in 2025 can feel like a daunting task. With many excellent options from both Apple and Android, pinpointing the perfect device for your needs might seem overwhelming. But don't worry; we're here to simplify your search.\n\nWe've meticulously curated a list of the top-performing smartphones available, considering everything from raw processing power and camera capabilities to battery life, display quality, and overall design. Whether you prioritize a blazing-fast processor for demanding tasks, a cutting-edge camera system to capture life's moments, or a long-lasting battery to keep you connected throughout the day, we're confident you'll find your ideal match on our list.\n\nTo further refine your search, we've also compiled specialized lists highlighting the  best iPhones  and  best Android phones , allowing you to dive straight into the ecosystem that best suits your preferences. So, relax, take a deep breath, and let us guide you toward the phone that perfectly aligns with your needs and desires.\n\nWhy you should buy this:  It's the best iPhone on the market right now. Yes, it's missing some of the features from the iPhone 16 Pro series, but those are easily forgotten when you realise how good this phone is.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: \u00a0Anyone who wants a new phone, but doesn't expect to have any need for the \"Pro\" options.\n\nWhy we picked the  iPhone 16 :\n\nApple has done something remarkable with the iPhone 16. Among the four models in the latest iPhone lineup, the base iPhone 16 is the most affordable and the least technically advanced. However, contrary to expectations, those shortcoming don't make it the least desirable phone in the roster. Instead, it's the iPhone you should in 2025 \u2014 at least, until the  iPhone 17  arrives.\n\nIn the past, the base model iPhone often felt like a clear downgrade compared to its Pro counterparts, but that\u2019s not the case this time. Apple has finally equalized the numbering system for its processors, meaning the iPhone 16's chip now has the same \"A18\" monikor as the higher-end entries in the range. Granted, it's not the A18 Pro, like you'll find in the iPhone 16 Pro, but the A18 is still a powerful and extremely capable processor.\n\nJoining this new internal hardware is a great new design. The overall shape of the phone is much the same, but Apple has ramped up the color saturation to eleven, drenching our eyeballs in a veritable cacaphony of color. The new colors are bold and beautiful, and match the direction Apple has taken with its phones in recent years. We'd be remiss if we didn't mention the newest addition to the phone too, an entirely new button. Named  Camera Control , this touchscreen button allows easy control of various camera features, and can be used to take photos too. It's a surprisingly helpful addition, and it's an even bigger surprise to see Apple bring it to the cheapest entry in the roster.\n\nThe camera is very solid, as ever, and the display is gorgeous. It's not all good news though, as Apple continues to use a 60Hz refresh rate on its two cheapest iPhone 16 models (boo), and there's also no always-on display. On the plus side, it gets access to Apple Intelligence, though actual use of the AI features is likely to vary from person-to-person.\n\nAll-in-all, the iPhone 16 is simply one of the best iPhones you can buy this year, and one of the best smartphones to boot. While there are more powerful phones out there, for value for your money, this is the iPhone to buy.\n\nWhy you should buy this:  If you have the cash, this is the most powerful iPhone you can purchase, with the largest display ever on an Apple phone.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: \u00a0Mobile camera junkies will absolutely love this phone, which comes with the best cameras and the largest iPhone display available. Did we mention Camera Control?\n\nWhy we picked the  iPhone 16 Pro Max :\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is a powerful device with a compelling feature set, but it's not a necessary upgrade for everyone. Users of older iPhones, especially those seeking a significant jump in camera capabilities, however, will appreciate the Pro Max's superior telephoto lens and upgraded 48-megapixel ultrawide lens. This translates to a noticeable improvement in image quality, particularly in lowlight conditions and when capturing distant subjects.\n\nIt shares a lot with the iPhone 16, including the newest features. That includes the Action button that offers quick shortcuts, Camera Control for customized shooting modes, an improved ultrawide lens, new Photographic Styles for personalized image aesthetics, an extended battery life, and a wider range of color options. As you might expect, it exceeds its budget brethren in a few ways, namely the more powerful A18 Pro processor, the 120Hz refresh rate, and faster charging speeds.\n\nThose who already own an  iPhone 15 Pro Max  might want to hold off on the upgrade. The iOS 18.1 update, with its Apple Intelligence features, bridges the gap in AI capabilities, potentially diminishing the iPhone 16 Pro Max's current advantage in this area. And, yes, Apple Intelligence is supported on 2023\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nUltimately, the iPhone 16 Pro Max caters to users with specific needs and priorities. Its key strengths lie in its advanced camera system with the enhanced telephoto lens, always-on display with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate for a more responsive user experience, and comprehensive photography and videography features designed for professional-level content creation. The iPhone 16 Pro Max will undoubtedly meet and exceed your expectations if these features are essential to your workflow or lifestyle. However, if your priorities differ, exploring the iPhone 16 or waiting for the Apple Intelligence update on the iPhone 15 Pro Max could be equally viable and cost-effective options.\n\nWhy you should buy this: \u00a0The Flagship Killer has struck again, delivering an incredible smartphone for the price.\n\nWho it's for: \u00a0Anyone looking for the best Android has to offer.\n\nWhy we picked the  OnePlus 13 :\n\nIf the OnePlus 12 marked a return to form for OnePlus, then the OnePlus 13 is an extension of that success. This year's OnePlus phone is a barnstormer, delivering incredible specs and performance that rival the most expensive flagships, at a few hundred dollars less than most.\n\nThe keystone of this performance can be found under the hood: The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. This is the same chip you'll see in the latest Android flagships, and it's as powerful as you'd expect. The Oneplus 13 will devour demanding games and apps alike, and will likely continue doing so for many years to come. Storage is similarly impressive, starting at a roomy 256GB, and rising to 512GB, and even the lofty heights of 1TB. Specs-wise, it's everything you could possibly want from a flagship.\n\nThe design is gorgeous, especially the Midnight Ocean variant, which comes with a bold blue vegan microfiber back, and a pairred IP69 and IP68 add a ton of water-resistance to the phone. The battery is similarly impressive, lasting up to two days on a single charge for most people. But it's recharging where it  really  shines, with 80W wired charging (100W outside of the U.S.), with 45W wireless charging as well. It's a true stand-out where ther battery is concerned. The cameras, too, are excellent.\n\nIs it all good? There are some areas where it struggles. The software is a little buggy, and while we expect those bugs to be smoothed out over time, the unreliable notifications are a real pain to deal with. But honestly, the downsides are few and far between. With some exceptional specs, beautiful design, excellent camera, and stand-out battery, the OnePlus 13 is a steal at $900.\n\nWhy you should buy this:  It's the perfect Android phone for someone looking for a smaller handset.\n\nWho it's for:  Anyone who wants a top-tier smaller Android phone that isn't made by OnePlus.\n\nWhy we picked the  Google Pixel 9 Pro :\n\nOur Google Pixel 9 Pro reviewer likes this phone so much that she\u2019s  considering ditching her iPhone . Yes, a long-time iPhone owner is considering heading over to Android.\n\nThis phone checks all the boxes \u2014 it has a beautiful compact size, a premium feel, an exceptional camera system with 5x optical zoom, and even a gorgeous rose quartz colorway.\n\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro features a 6.3-inch Super Actua OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and comes in hazel, obsidian, and porcelain. Like other phones in the Pixel 9 series, it also includes a newly designed camera shelf that no longer extends to both sides of the phone. It\u2019s an impressive look that is completely different, but it does not detract from the Pixel style Google has perfected over the years.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. Unlike previous Pixel models, this one is praised for its long battery life, lasting about 24 hours between charges while performing everyday tasks. The fastest wired charging speed here is 27W, which allows you to get a 55% charge in about 30 minutes and just over an hour for a full charge.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro also includes one free year of Google Gemini Advanced and gives you seven years of software updates.\n\nIf you love this phone but would prefer a larger display, you\u2019re in luck. Google has resurrected the XL label for the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This big phone includes all the great features of the regular Pro model but with a 6.8-inch Super Actua display. That phone also offers wired charging of up to 37W.\n\nWith the Pixel 9 Pro, Google gave small-phone lovers a pro-level experience without compromise.\n\nWhy you should buy this:  The Samsung Galaxy A14 5G looks good and packs a punch for a budget price.\n\nWho it\u2019s for:  Buyers on a budget looking for a safe, sensible choice that won't disappoint.\n\nWhy we picked the  Samsung Galaxy A14 5G :\n\nAre you on a budget but want great value? Then you can't go wrong with Samsung's A-Series phones, which are excellent for the price. The Galaxy A14 5G is no longer one of the latest entries in the family, but it's still well worth your attention.\n\nWith the Galaxy A14 5G, you get a large, 6.6-inch LCD display that has a 1080p resolution with a 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. Though you do get some bezels around the display, the screen itself looks nice, has vibrant colors, and you get relatively smooth scrolling with the 90Hz refresh rate. The design of the phone itself is simple and minimalistic, and the plastic back has a unique texture that helps give you more grip than the glass on most phones.\n\nThe A14 5G has 4GB of RAM and a MediaTek MT6833 Dimensity 700 chip. So while it's not packing the newest Snapdragon 8 Elite, it has decent performance for the price. You may notice a tiny bit of stutter when navigating the phone's interface or opening up apps, but considering that the phone is just $200, it's expected. It only comes with 64GB of storage, but that can expand to 1TB through a microSD card. Samsung ships the A14 5G with Android 13 and OneUI 5, and you will get two major Android upgrades and four years of security updates. For $200, you're getting a good amount of longevity, especially considering that this phone is 5G-capable.\n\nThe camera is also quite impressive, as you get a 50MP main shooter, with a 2MP macro and 2MP depth sensors. Thanks to the MediaTek chip, taking photos is fast and the results are quite good for a $200 phone. When the phone was used to capture some in-motion shots of a child, the results came out quite well. Colors are also bright and punchy, like most of Samsung's other higher-end phones.\n\nAnd lastly, though the Galaxy A14 5G doesn't have wireless charging, it does have a massive 5,000mAh battery that will last at least two days with regular use. But wired charging caps out at 15W, so it's a little slow. However, considering how much use you'll get from a single charge, you may not be having to plug it in every night.\n\nWhy you should buy this:  The Samsung Galaxy A35 has the flagship looks and features without the flagship price.\n\nWho it\u2019s for:  Anyone who wants a phone that looks like Samsung's previous flagship and has good performance \u2014 but for half the price.\n\nWhy we picked the  Samsung Galaxy A35 :\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 offers a lot of flagship features for less. For the most part, it looks and feels like the Galaxy S24, with a few minor modifications, like the raised section on the side of the phone for the volume and power buttons. But the camera module looks the same as the S24, so you could mistake it for the higher-end S24 from a distance.\n\nThe Galaxy A35 is slightly bigger than the S24 with a 6.6-inch Super AMOLED display, and it even has a 120Hz refresh rate on the screen. This means scrolling through the system and apps and playing games is smooth and easy on the eyes, and the colors are vibrant and rich with deep blacks.\n\nThough the chassis is made of plastic, the screen has Gorilla Glass Victus Plus, so it's quite durable, and it has an IP67 rating. The phone feels nice in the hand, and the increased brightness to 1,000 nits makes it easy to see when outdoors.\n\nYou get a 50MP main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS), as well as a 8MP wide-angle camera and a 5MP macro lens. The front-facing selfie camera is 13MP. Photos that are taken with the A35 will appear bright, colorful, and vibrant. However, as Samsung typically oversaturates colors, sometimes the primary colors may have a little too much punch to them, as it's over amplified. But photos with the ultrawide lens may appear a little bit dull and washed out due to the lower megapixel count. Thankfully, there are plenty of tools in the photo-editing suite to change up your photos if need be. The selfie camera is pretty average, and good enough to capture a quick selfie every now and then.\n\nSamsung put its Exynos 1380 processor inside, with a minimum of 6GB RAM that is configurable up to 12GB, and 128GB or 256GB storage, plus you have a microSD card slot. While the Exynos 1380 chipset may not be as fast as the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 series, it's still reasonably fast and performs well for the price. It comes with Android 14 and One UI 6.1, which is the same as the S24. Samsung promises software upgrades for the next four years, with five years of security updates.\n\nThough the Galaxy A35 has a 5,000mAh battery inside, it won't get you through two consecutive days without a charge overnight. That said, it should last most of the day if that's all you need. It charges at a maximum speed of 25W, and unfortunately, there's no wireless charging.\n\nWhy you should buy this:  It's a worthy successor to the Flagship Killer brand, and the best $600 you can spend on a phone.\n\nWho it's for:  Anyone who loves getting great value from their money.\n\nWhy we picked the  OnePlus 13R :\n\nOnePlus isn't just about the high-end flagships, it can also put out a stormer of a mid-range smartphone too. The OnePLus 13R is the follow-up to last year's excellent  OnePlus 12R , and it's no less deserving of its place on this list.\n\nAs ever, OnePlus doesn't skimp when it comes to pure power. While the 13R may not have the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it does use last generations Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, still a stupendously powerful processor. It won't put up the same numbers as the 8 Elite, but it was the top tier of power only last year, and still extremely capable as a result. Storage options are also excellent, starting at 256GB and rising to 512GB. The battery must be disappointing then, right? Nope, that's a slam dunk too, and you'll get two days (or maybe more) out of a single charge of the 6,000mAh cell.\n\nWhat are the downsides? If we're being really critical, the cameras are good, but could be better, and the price increase of $100 from the last generation was certainly unwelcome. Oh, and the charging speeds have taken a dip, down to a  mere  55W. Though that's still faster than most flagship phones you'll find from Samsung, Apple, and Google, so it's worth keeping in mind that everything is relative.\n\nThere's really not much to say other than that this is  excellent  smartphone for $600, and a must-buy if you're looking to spend that much money on a new phone. The OnePlus 13R is the best value phone you can get, and it's hard to see it being unseated any time soon.\n\nWhy you should buy this: \u00a0This is just like the best iPhone of the year, but with a larger display.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: \u00a0You want the most impressive iPhone on the market, but need a bigger display than the iPhone 16 can provide.\n\n**Why we picked the  iPhone 16 Plus :\n\nThe iPhone 16 Plus is a fantastic device that shares many features with our most recommended iPhone this year, the regular-sized iPhone 16, but it has a larger display. However, this larger screen comes with a higher price tag, which may lead some users to consider the iPhone 16 Pro Max as a better option.\n\nWhile the iPhone 16 Plus offers great features, like the Action Button, Camera Control, and support for Apple Intelligence, it does come with some compromises compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Notably, the display refresh rate is 60Hz, whereas the Pro model has a smoother 120Hz. Additionally, the battery life of the iPhone 16 Plus is somewhat lacking, providing up to five hours less usage between charges compared to the Pro version. The Plus model also has a slightly less powerful chipset and fewer storage options.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, the iPhone 16 Plus still delivers a large-screen experience without the premium \"Pro\" price, though it lacks some standout features of the Pro models that some users may find worth the upgrade.\n\nWhy you should buy this: \u00a0Apple's new entry-level iPhone provides all the power of the flagship iPhone 16 in a much more affordable package.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: \u00a0Those looking for a no-frills iPhone that delivers all the latest Apple Intelligence features.\n\nWhy we picked the iPhone 16e\n\nApple surprised everyone this year when it retired its aging iPhone SE lineup in favor of something entirely different: a third tier in its mainstream iPhone 16 family. While the iPhone 16e is pricier than the wallet-friendly model it replaced, Apple has brought it into modern times in several significant ways.\n\nFor one thing, you get the latest A18 chip, virtually the same one that's used in the iPhone 16. It has one less GPU core, but we don't expect that's something most folks will notice. There's more than enough power here to provide a smooth user experience and support the entire suite of Apple Intelligence features \u2014\u00a0including  Visual Intelligence , which can now be assigned to the Action button, since the iPhone 16e lacks the Camera Control of its pricier siblings.\n\nEven more significantly, the iPhone 16e finally leaves Touch ID behind, adopting the same Face ID capabilities as every mainstream iPhone that's been released since 2018, along with an OLED screen. The only real downside here is that the design is a throwback to the iPhone 14, which means you get a notch in the screen instead of Apple's newer Dynamic Island, plus the same display found on that older model. It's crisp and clear, but doesn't get quite as bright as the one used in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, which means you may struggle a bit if you plan to use it outdoors on really bright days.\n\nPerhaps the biggest drawback is that you only get a single camera. It's a surprisingly good single camera, with a 48-megapixel (MP) resolution that allows for a pixel-cropped 2X zoom, but there's still only so much you can do with one lens. The specs are similar to the primary camera on the iPhone 16 on paper, but it's using an older sensor, so it's a bit slower, and it lacks sensor-shift optical image stablization, which leaves out features like Action mode video recording.\n\nThe absence of the ultrawide lens also means there's no macro photography or support for spatial photos and videos or cinematic mode. To be fair, these are all bonus features on ", "excerpt": "Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.

Picking between them is going to form a big part of your smartphone choice, right? Sort of.\n\nApple's iOS and Google's Android are completely separate systems, so any apps or games you buy on one will not transfer over to the other. If you're heavily invested into one or the other already, that should play a part in whether you want to buy a phone running the other OS. But don't let it put you off entirely: Most of the apps you'll find on one, you'll also find on the other, and even if your purchases won't transfer over, you'll still be able to to find the same general experience from the free apps you use.\n\nApple's iOS is definitely the more unified experience. Since only Apple makes devices that use iOS, it decides how it looks, feels, and functions \u2014 down to the very last transition. Android is a lot more fluid and dynamic. While Google has its own design choices, other manufacturers are free to change the look and feel as they prefer by creating what's commonly referred to as a \"skin.\" Samsung's One UI is probably the best known of these. While this has its advantages, sometimes these changes can make a phone feel drastically different. Sometimes this is better, sometimes it's worse. While you always know what you're going to get with iOS, Android can be a bit more of a mixed bag.\n\nSoftware updates are hit by this same dynamic. Apple's control means it can push out updates on day one or two of a new patch or iOS version being available. Google can do that for its own Pixel devices, but updates to phones made by Samsung, Nokia, OnePlus, or other manufacturers will take longer \u2014 largely because each company will have to make sure the update works with its own skin or software. As a result, it can be anywhere between weeks and months before some Android phones get updated to the latest version of Android. This can be important when updates contain bug fixes or security patches, and even if those are pushed through as a priority, they'll still be landing later than they would on iPhone.\n\nUltimately, while there are differences between the two operating systems, there are far more similarities when it comes to Android and iOS. Both have largely the same selection of apps and games, and the day-to-day experience is much the same. While there definitely are differences, swapping to Android from iPhone (or vice versa) won't leave you confused."}}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Question", "name": "Can smartphones get viruses?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Answer", "text": "While it is possible to get viruses on iPhones or Android phones, what most people mean when they say \"virus\" is malware.
