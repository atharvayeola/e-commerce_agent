Expect a generous cut through the top of the leg with a neat taper towards the ankle. This is for the wide leg lovers.\n\nPlease select your fabric choice from the options below, as well as your desired waistline details and inside-leg measurement; we make each pair to your custom specification.\n\nLooking for a 2- piece? Pair it with our\u00a0 Partner jacket \u00a0 \u2013 available to be made in all the same fabrics as all our trousers and in two different seasonal lengths.\n\n--\n\nDETAILS\n\n\u2013 Double reverse pleats \u2013 High-waisted fit \u2013 1/2 inch dropped belt loops / side adjusters \u2013 15.5\u00a0inch +/- front rise \u2013 Wide leg with a generous thigh, the tapered shape runs from below the knee towards the ankle. Hem width will depend on your leg length and waist size selected. Hem width ranges from 7.5 - 8.75 inch on average depending on your size \u2013 Double back pocket - one pocket has a button fastening.\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\n\nDry-clean only (fabric dependant)\n\nSIZING\n\nHow to take your waist measurement \u2013\u00a0 Due to the high-waisted fit of these trousers, a correct waist  measurement should be taken 1.5 inches above your belly-button/hip line.  Use a tape measure on your skin, applying a small amount of pressure to obtain a good reading. We use your natural waist measurement to make your trousers, please don\u2019t rely on what size jeans or trousers you normally shop for as these sizes generally allow for an extra 1/2 inches for ease. In most cases, you will measure 1-2 inches larger than what you are used to, eg. if you normally take a 34 inch trouser (off-the-rack), your natural waist will measure a 35/36 inch. Please see the diagram below for an illustration of how to take your measurement, if you have anymore questions please get in touch.\n\nHow long does the inside leg length come?  \u2013 We offer a free leg-alteration option on all our trousers so they\u2019re ready to go when they arrive with you. Please select your leg length or opt-out if you want to receive them with a long and un-hemmed 36 inch inside leg for you to alter if you are unsure and want to get it just right. We recommend a turn-up finish (2.5 inch as standard when selecting this option) on this pant hem that has a gathering and break over the shoe, just the way they used to wear them. Add 1 - 1.5 inches onto your usual inside leg measurement if you're used to wearing our trousers (Classic wide leg / Empire trousers).\n\nPlease note, as these are made-to-order we do not accept returns or offer refunds. We're totally committed to selling high-quality products and hope that you'll never find yourself in this position.
