However, the focus remains on the more expensive Pro series.\n\nThe  iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max  now offer better thermals to keep the device cool, an aluminum build for more funky colors, and a few other essential quality-of-life improvements.\n\nAlso:\u00a0 Everything Apple announced during its September event\n\nIf you're eyeing the  iPhone 16 Pro  at lower prices in the market or own one already, here's how the latest-gen iPhone compares to its predecessor.\n\nApple says the iPhone 17 Pro is the most durable iPhone ever. It features Ceramic Shield 2 on the front, which is said to be three times scratch-resistant than before. Additionally, there's Ceramic Shield on the back, which is four times stronger than before. If your current iPhone is prone to scratches and bothersome to you, the iPhone 17 Pro would be the perfect new phone.\n\nI am an iPhone 16 Pro user, and my biggest problem with it is screen legibility in direct sunlight. I need to wipe the display whenever I want to use it outdoors. It gets smudgy and doesn't get bright enough for a comfortable viewing experience. Apple seems to have fixed this issue with the iPhone 17 Pro.\n\nAlso:\u00a0 How to preorder Apple's new devices: iPhone 17, Watch 11, AirPods Pro 3, and more\n\nAs mentioned, the new Pro iPhone sports Ceramic Shield 2 on the front. It isn't just more resistant to scratches but also adds a 7-layer anti-reflective coating on top of your screen. This is paired with a display that is rated to go up to 3,000 nits in peak brightness outdoors (vs. 2,000 nits on the 16 Pro). Theoretically, it is a quality-of-life improvement, which should offer a more legible experience.\n\nApple also improved the performance and battery life on its new iPhone 17 Pro. According to the company, it can last up to eight hours longer (in video playback) than before.\n\nThe new Apple A19 Pro chipset is combined with a vapor cooling chamber to offer better thermal management. It offers 40% better sustained performance than before. The Cupertino giant said this is \"MacBook Pro levels of compute in an iPhone.\" We'll test to find out in our review, but the claims do look promising.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro houses a new 18MP selfie camera with support for Center Stage and \"ultrastabilized\" video recording. If you regularly record yourself, these two features will be immensely useful in your creations. Now, while running, you can record clear videos without all the shaky movements, and Center Stage will keep you in the frame, too.\n\nThe Apple iPhone 17 sports its most experimental rear design change in years. Until last year, Apple stuck to a design it pioneered years ago with the introduction of a three-camera layout on the  iPhone 11  series.\n\nThe camera module has only gotten bigger in the last five generations, but with the iPhone 17, it now extends to the other side of the phone. This might not be a design that die-hard Apple users wanted. And if you are one of them, the iPhone 16 Pro is the better phone for you.\n\nThe Pro iPhones are only getting more expensive. But if you can get one near the price of an iPhone 17, even if it is a last-gen product, it makes sense to save a few hundred dollars and get the  iPhone 16 Pro  over the iPhone 17 Pro.\n\nAlso:  We tested the iPhone 16 Pro camera system, and it's highly underrated - with one tragic flaw\n\nIt'll still give you versatile cameras, ProMotion screens, the goodness of iOS 26, and a decent battery life. With the iPhone 17 lineup going on sale in the coming weeks, the iPhone 16 Pro should be available for lower prices, and if you can get a good deal, go for it!\n\nThe Pro iPhone series has been getting heavier every year since Apple announced the lightest iPhone 15 Pro (187 grams). It shot up to 199 grams with the iPhone 16 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro now sits at 206 grams (back to iPhone 14 Pro weight) on the scale. A 200g+ phone might not be for everyone. So, if you want the lightest possible device out of these two, the iPhone 16 Pro is the phone to go for.\n\nWant to follow my work?\u00a0 Add ZDNET as a trusted source on Google .", "excerpt": "'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean?\n\nZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping.
