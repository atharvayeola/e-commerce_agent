When you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.   Learn more \u203a\n\nBy  Kimber Streams  and  Dave Gershgorn\n\nIt's the final Prime Day of the year! See all of the  (actually good) deals  our experts have spotted so far.\n\nPlus: Sign up for  Wirecutter\u2019s daily newsletter  to get handpicked deals straight to your inbox.\n\nAfter a new round of testing, we\u2019ve added our new top pick for Windows laptops, the  Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 (14\u2033 Intel) .\n\nSmartphones and tablets may have taken over much of people\u2019s screen time, but there\u2019s still a need for a real computer sometimes \u2014 and for most people, that means a laptop. For school and office work and tasks like creating spreadsheets and editing video, there\u2019s no good substitute for a decent keyboard and a big screen. But exactly which laptop you should get depends on how often you\u2019ll use it, what you\u2019ll use it for, and (of course) how much money you can afford to spend on it.\n\nWe regularly test the most promising laptops, from sleek ultrabooks to cheap Chromebooks to massive gaming laptops and beyond. Here are the best models you can buy in every category, along with advice on how to choose which type of laptop is right for you.\n\nIf you\u2019re already familiar with macOS or Windows, the easiest choice is to buy a computer that runs that operating system. Or if you already have an iPhone, a MacBook will let you send texts with iMessage, make FaceTime video calls, and access your iCloud photos. That said, macOS and Windows have never been more similar, and most popular apps work just as well on either platform (or at least have alternatives that work similarly). If you\u2019re interested in switching, it isn\u2019t as big a deal as it used to be.\n\nIf you\u2019re not tied to a platform, the biggest factor is how easily you can get support. Do you have an Apple Store nearby? Do your most tech-savvy friends use Windows? Does your school or job provide tech support? If you\u2019re not a self-sufficient techie and want the best service for your computer, buy a Mac, because you can take it to any Apple Store to get it fixed. No other computer maker provides that level of support. (If you\u2019re self-sufficient, go with what you like.)\n\nAlternatively, since more tasks can be accomplished in a browser, without your downloading and installing any apps, you might not even need a traditional operating system \u2014 a  Chromebook  may be all you need.\n\nThe Yoga 7i has fast performance, terrific battery life, a vivid, OLED touchscreen, and a 360-degree hinge. But it\u2019s a bit heavy.\n\nYou save $200 (18%)\n\nRecommended configuration\n\nWho these are for:  Our Windows laptop picks are for anyone who needs a thin-and-light, super-portable Windows laptop with long battery life to get through a full day of work or classes. They\u2019re powerful enough to do everything most people need a computer for, and they have great keyboards, trackpads, and displays. You can expect to pay between $900 and $1,300 for a great Windows laptop that will last you at least four years, though excellent budget options are available for around $800.\n\nWhere they fall short:  Thin-and-light Windows laptops tend to cost more than most people want to spend, but they last years longer than cheap laptops under $500. They also lack the processing power to play high-end games or handle demanding tasks such as professional video editing or 3D modeling.\n\nWhy we like this one:  The  Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 (14\u2033 Intel)  is the best Windows laptop for most people\u2019s needs. It has the best combination of what makes a laptop great: fast performance, terrific battery life, a spacious OLED touchscreen, a comfortable keyboard, and a reliable trackpad, all for a reasonable price. And because it has a 360-degree hinge, you can use it as a tablet, too. With nearly 16 hours of battery life, the Yoga 7i will last through a full day of work or classes \u2014 and then some \u2014 and it\u2019s compact enough to take to a coffee shop or on a plane. At just over 3 pounds it\u2019s a little heavy, but otherwise this laptop has no major flaws.\n\nRead more about the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 and other so-called AI PCs in  our full guide to Windows laptops .\n\nThe M4 MacBook Air is a slim, powerful Apple laptop that has a notably upgraded 12-megapixel webcam.\n\nYou save $50 (6%)\n\nYou save $50 (6%)\n\nCostco membership required\n\nRecommended configuration\n\nWho these are for:  If you prefer macOS or need great tech support, a  MacBook  is a safe bet; this is an excellent laptop for writers, office workers, commuters, and college students. The 13-inch models offer the best combination of size, weight, and performance. Powered by Apple\u2019s M-series processors, these laptops have exceptionally good battery life compared with similarly priced Windows laptops. We recommend the M2 MacBook Air, which delivers performance that\u2019s nearly as good as that of the M4 MacBook Pro under all but the heaviest workloads for hundreds of dollars less.\n\nWhere they fall short : MacBooks are typically more expensive than Windows ultrabooks, especially if you want to upgrade the memory or storage \u2014 Apple\u2019s SSD upgrade prices are so high that we usually recommend looking into cloud storage or an  external SSD  instead. Our recommended MacBook configuration lacks the processing power to play demanding games. If you need a cheaper laptop or a more powerful one, check out our other picks below.\n\nWhy we like this one:  The  13-inch M4 MacBook Air  delivers great performance and fantastic battery life at a reasonable price. The base 16 GB of memory that\u2019s offered is enough for basic web browsing and office tasks, as well as if you need to do some basic video or media editing. If you\u2019re the kind of person who has a few dozen browser tabs open at a time, we recommend upgrading the RAM to 24 GB. Like Apple\u2019s other laptops, the MacBook Air has only a few ports \u2014 in this case, two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, which may require you to use a  hub  or  new cables . But the MacBook Air\u2019s light weight, solid construction, and  industry-leading support  make it a great laptop, especially if you also own an  iPhone  or other Apple devices.\n\nFor more on the MacBook Air, take a look at our  full guide to MacBook models .\n\nThe Framework Laptop is the best \u2014 and so far only \u2014 option if you want a laptop that you can easily upgrade and repair. And it\u2019s a great laptop, too.\n\nRecommended configuration\n\nWho these are for:  Most modern laptops aren\u2019t designed to be repaired or upgraded by just anyone with a screwdriver. Even if you do manage to get past the screws and the difficult-to-pry-open chassis, you might have access to the SSD, but the memory is likely to be soldered, and you certainly can\u2019t upgrade the processor. When something breaks out of warranty, when the battery wears out, or when you\u2019re ready to upgrade after five or six years, you have to recycle or dispose of the entire laptop \u2014 even if some of its parts are still perfectly good. If you want the ability to upgrade and repair your laptop yourself and make it last longer without replacing the whole thing \u2014 which theoretically can save you money and create  less e-waste  over the years \u2014 our repairable pick is for you.\n\nWhere they fall short:  The availability of parts and upgrades for the Framework Laptop 13 is entirely dependent on the laptop\u2019s manufacturer. If Framework goes under or it decides to stop designing and selling upgrades, this laptop will end up just like any other \u2014 when the computer breaks or outlives its usefulness, you\u2019ll have to replace the whole thing. Other companies have attempted to make upgradable laptops in the past and have  failed to follow through  on the promise.\n\nWhy we like this one:  Every part of the  Framework Laptop 13 (AMD AI 300 Series) \u00a0is  super easy to repair and upgrade . Each part is helpfully labeled with handy QR codes that direct you to  step-by-step replacement guides  and links to the exact parts you\u2019ll need. You can add more  memory and storage ,  replace the battery , upgrade the  mainboard with a new processor , and repair  anything else  if it breaks \u2014 the display, the fingerprint reader, the keyboard, the hinge, you name it.\n\nThe Framework Laptop 13 is an excellent computer, too. It\u2019s sturdy and surprisingly thin and light for how modular its design is, and its battery will last a full workday. It also has a reliable keyboard and trackpad, plus a bright and spacious display. But the ability to upgrade and repair this laptop down the line depends on the company continuing to exist and to supply parts. So far the company is off to a great start: Every year since it launched in 2021 the company has introduced upgraded parts.\n\nIf you want the full experience of  putting your laptop together , you can choose from a wider variety of parts by purchasing the  DIY Edition  instead.\n\nRead more about our repairable pick in our guide to  Windows laptops .\n\nReliable performance, a spacious touch display, and a long battery life make this model the best Chromebook. But it lacks a 360-degree hinge, and its webcam and speakers are mediocre.\n\nCostco membership required, price includes $15 shipping\n\nRecommended configuration\n\nWho these are for:  Chromebooks are ideal for students and kids, but you should also consider one if you spend most of your computer time in a web browser, if you\u2019re on a tight budget, or if you already have a decent desktop PC. A good Chromebook can do  almost anything a regular laptop can do , including document work, video calls, and streaming video \u2014 as long as it\u2019s possible in a web browser or in Android apps. And $500 Chromebooks tend to be faster, lighter, and sleeker than $500 Windows laptops.\n\nWhere they fall short:  Chromebooks can\u2019t run Windows-specific games or particular programs you might be used to on your Mac or Windows computer. But if you use web-based email, if you can get by with Google\u2019s office web apps or  Office 365  and Android app alternatives, and if you stream your music and movies over the internet, a Chromebook should do just about everything you need it to.\n\nWhy we like this one:  The  Acer Chromebook Plus 514 (CB514-6HT-368E)  provides the best balance of features for the price out of all the Chromebooks we\u2019ve tested. It has fast performance, a backlit keyboard, a reliable trackpad, and a tall and spacious touchscreen. The Chromebook Plus 514 is also light and portable, with long-enough battery life to last a full day of work or classes. This model doesn\u2019t cut any major corners to hit its reasonable price, though it lacks a 360-degree hinge, and its speakers and webcam aren\u2019t great.\n\nFor more, read our  full guide to Chromebooks .\n\nUnlike most cheap Windows laptops, the Aspire 3 is fast, compact, and light, and it has long battery life and a 1080p display.\n\nRecommended configuration\n\nWho these are for:  If you need a Windows laptop for home, work, or school \u2014 and you can\u2019t afford to spend a lot \u2014 you can find a decent one for less than $500. These computers are ideal for grade-school and middle-school students, people on a strict budget, and those who use their computers mostly at home in the evenings for doing schoolwork, browsing the web, managing a budget, or watching Netflix. Cheaper, lighter laptops tend to be too slow for everyday tasks, while faster, sleeker ones usually cost too much.\n\nWhere they fall short:  To get a laptop that doesn\u2019t feel slow for a decent price, you have to make a lot of compromises. Most budget laptops that are fast enough tend to be bulky, heavy, and saddled with short battery life. They also tend to have low-resolution, low-quality screens that are unpleasant to look at. You have to be especially vigilant when shopping for a laptop in this price range to avoid slow or old processors, insufficient memory, and sluggish storage.\n\nWhy we like this one:  The  Acer Aspire 3 (A314-23P-R3QA)  is fast enough to meet most people\u2019s computing needs for years to come, and it has an accurate trackpad and a backlit keyboard. It\u2019s also compact and portable, and its battery lasted 13 hours 38 minutes in our tests \u2014 long enough to get through a full day of work or classes.\n\nThe Aspire 3 has a 14-inch 1920\u00d71080 display that lacks touch input and makes colors look dull and washed out in comparison with more expensive laptops. But many laptops in this price range have much worse screens with lower resolutions or TN panels. The Aspire 3 also comes with a ton of bloatware; we recommend  following these steps  to get rid of it.\n\nChoosing a budget laptop is tricky because you can find hundreds of variations. Their prices fluctuate constantly, too, and companies release and discontinue models with no warning. If our pick isn\u2019t available,  check our full guide to budget laptops  for other options, as well as advice on how to shop for a budget laptop that doesn\u2019t suck.\n\nFor additional details, read our  full guide to budget laptops .\n\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro is fast, has an incredibly accurate screen, and boasts impressive battery life to boot.\n\nRecommended configuration\n\nWho these are for:  Photo and video editors need an extremely color-accurate screen, the processing power to work with 4K footage or to batch-edit hundreds of photos, and a battery that will last through an entire day\u2019s work. These professional-grade laptops are more costly than ultrabooks, ranging from $2,000 to $3,000, but they offer desktop performance away from the desk.\n\nWhere they fall short:  Laptops with color-accurate screens and enough power for creative professionals are expensive, and even more so with add-ons like extra storage and memory. Editing laptops also tend to be larger and heavier than ultrabooks, with most weighing more than 4 pounds. The powerful processors in editing laptops generate lots of heat, as well, so some can get too hot to use comfortably on your lap, though our top pick stayed cool even under the heaviest workloads. In addition, the MacBook Pro is impossible to service on your own, but Apple provides excellent support.\n\nWhy we like this one:  The  Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4 Pro, 2024)  combines a sharp display that\u2019s color-accurate out of the box with Apple\u2019s powerful and power-efficient M4 Pro processor. We found the laptop quick and responsive even when we were working with large 4K files. The Asus ProArt is faster at exporting 4K video, but that\u2019s just one part of the video-editing process, and the MacBook Pro was a bit snappier when bringing clips into the editing timeline.\n\nIn addition to the MacBook Pro\u2019s performance, we were impressed with its 17.5-hour battery life. It has three USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 5, as well as an HDMI port, an SD card reader, a headphone jack, and a MagSafe charging port. While the performance of the MacBook Pro is stellar, it\u2019s nearly impossible to repair or upgrade on your own. If you\u2019re willing to sacrifice some speed for a more repairable machine, check out our recommendation below for a Windows laptop.\n\nRead more about the 16-inch MacBook Pro in our  full guide to pro laptops .\n\nThe Asus ProArt P16 has a fast AMD processor, a bright OLED display, and an Nvidia RTX graphics card to rip through video edits.\n\nRecommended configuration\n\nWho these are for:  If you\u2019re a creative professional and you prefer Windows to macOS, don\u2019t want a Mac, or are required to use Windows for compatibility reasons, this is your pick. In recent years, Windows ultrabooks have struggled to match the performance of the MacBook Pro models, though our new pick, the Asus ProArt 16, is one of the first Windows laptops to beat the MacBooks in our editing tests. Also, if you need a specific port or feature, you\u2019re also more likely to find it on a Windows laptop than on a Mac, simply because the Windows world has more manufacturers and variety compared with Apple\u2019s MacBooks.\n\nWhere they fall short:  As a whole, Windows laptops didn\u2019t perform as well in our tests as the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Typically, their screens were less accurate, they were a bit slower, and they got hotter underneath where the processor was located. Certain models, such as the Asus ProArt 16 we recommend, can still go toe-to-toe with the MacBook in terms of speed, but Apple computers typically have better displays, and the systems stay cooler with quieter fans.\n\nWhy we like this one:  The  Asus ProArt P16 \u00a0is the first Windows laptop to beat Apple machines\u2019 performance when exporting large 4K videos, and it\u2019s an all-around great laptop for media editing. It has an accurate 4K OLED display, a nice keyboard and speakers, and a control wheel on the trackpad that you can assign to scrub through your Premiere timeline or control specific sliders in other editing software. Its display also has a 120 Hz refresh rate, so motion will seem smoother, and it\u2019s better for some gaming on the side, if that\u2019s your bag. The P16 has more ports than the MacBook Pro as well, adding two extra USB-A ports. However, its battery life is significantly shorter than that of the MacBook Pro, by about seven hours.\n\nRead more about this option in our  full guide to pro laptops .\n\nThis laptop has the newest generation of hardware and performs better than some of the most expensive models we tested. It maintains great frame rates for smooth gameplay, and it stays quiet and cool to the touch.\n\nMay be out of stock\n\nRecommended configuration\n\nWho these are for:  If you want to play games but also need an affordable laptop for school or work \u2014 and your top priority isn\u2019t playing the newest games at maxed-out graphics settings at QHD or 4K resolution \u2014 a cheap gaming laptop is for you. Nowadays, a gaming laptop that costs around $1,500 can play most new games on high settings or better at 1920\u00d71080 resolution above 60 fps. Even cheaper models that cost around $800 are ideal for classic games and less-demanding modern titles, and they can play most new games on at least medium settings. You don\u2019t need to spend $2,000 on a more powerful gaming laptop to get great performance.\n\nWhere they fall short:  Every affordable gaming laptop we\u2019ve tested has had at least one serious flaw. Some get way too hot, others have poor build quality, and some have dim screens with poor viewing angles. And compared with more portable options, such as ultrabooks, all gaming laptops are large, heavy, and saddled with short battery life.\n\nWhy we like this one:  The  Asus TUF Gaming A14 (FA401UV-DB74)  provides great gaming performance for the price. It can play most of the newest titles at high and ultra settings, maintaining excellent frame rates while doing so. It also keeps its most-touched surfaces cool during long gaming sessions, and it comes with nice extras, such as a comfortable RGB keyboard and a screen with a high, 165 Hz refresh rate. It has decent battery life, and it\u2019s similar in size and weight to a 14-inch MacBook Pro \u2014 so it\u2019s more portable than most of the other gaming laptops we\u2019ve tested.\n\nYou can read more about our pick in  our full guide to cheap gaming laptops .\n\nThis article was edited by Signe Brewster and Arthur Gies.\n\nKimber Streams\n\nI\u2019ve been Wirecutter\u2019s resident laptop expert for more than a decade.
