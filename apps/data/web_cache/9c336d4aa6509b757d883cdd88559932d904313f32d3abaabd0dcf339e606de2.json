How it works", "text": "Need to make a last-minute addition to your latest  Amazon Prime order ? Well, you're in luck because there's a new way to make changes on the  Amazon  app.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has launched a new feature on its app called  \"Add to Delivery,\"  a button that allows customers to add additional items to a delivery for an order that has already been placed.\n\nThe option is available exclusively to Prime members. Not all items are eligible for \"Add to Delivery\" \u2014 a blue button will appear alongside the existing \"Add to cart\" option if items qualify.\n\n\"If we can still add to your delivery that\u2019s arriving later today or tomorrow, you\u2019ll see the Add to Delivery option as you shop, and with one tap you\u2019ll be done,\" Amazon said in a  news release.\n\nThe new \"Add to Delivery\" feature is only available on the Amazon Shopping mobile app or  Amazon.com  on mobile devices.\n\nEligible items will have a blue \"Add to Delivery\" button on the product's details page. If tapped, the item will be added automatically to an upcoming delivery. There is an \"undo\" option right away if the button was tapped erroneously.\n\nIt's not necessary to go through checkout again to use the \"Add to Delivery\" option. There are also no additional shipping costs associated with using the feature.\n\nThe \"Add to Delivery\" option is only available for Amazon Prime members in the United States.\n\nPrime is available for $14.99/month or $139/year, with a 30-day free trial for eligible customers.
