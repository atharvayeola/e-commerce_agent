And it's often on sale for under $200.\n\nFor Android owners, the best smartwatch is the  Google Pixel Watch 3 , which includes many of Fitbit's best holistic features for a starting price of $349. Recently refreshed by way of the  Pixel Watch 4 , the older model offers a similar set of features and remains our top pick for now.\n\nFor a cheaper alternative, the  Samsung Galaxy Watch 7  is another well-rounded option with best-in-class sleep insights (the same ones you get from the newer  Galaxy Watch 8 ).\n\nNot sure if a smartwatch is even right for you?

It also offers the same class-leading sleep insights and sleep apnea detection as the newer Galaxy Watch 8, and most of the same features, but can easily be picked up for well under $300.\n\nRead more below\n\nBest Android smartwatch\n\nThe Google Pixel Watch 3 in 45mm is the best Android smartwatch overall boasting up to 48 hours of battery life per charge, a comfortable and relatively elegant design, and plenty of wellness monitoring tools. It's not quite as sleek as the Galaxy Watch 7 but it still looks pretty stylish on the wrist and offers a similar level of smart features, too.\n\nRead more below\n\nBest affordable smartwatch\n\nThe Apple Watch SE 3 is an incredible value and the best affordable smartwatch out there today, offering many of the best Apple Watch features at a fraction of the price. It even comes with LTE, making it a solid low-cost device for safety and connectivity. Plus, the 40mm version is great for folks with smaller wrists. Of course, you'll need an iPhone to use it.\n\nRead more below\n\nBest smartwatch for fitness\n\nThe Garmin Venu 3 boasts many of the brand's best fitness tracking and training tools, wellness insights and sleep data. It also sports a bright and easy-to-view screen, outstanding battery life, rock-solid GPS and compatibility with both Apple and Android devices.

It\u2019s not a major upgrade over the Apple Watch Series 10 but there are some noteworthy changes.\n\nThe main difference between the  Apple Watch 11 vs Apple Watch 10  is the battery life. The newer watch now has 24 hours of battery life, which is an improvement on its predecessor's 18 hours.\n\nOn the surface, the Apple Watch 11 looks idential to the Apple Watch 10, which had a big redesign compared to the Series 9. It's still easy to view at odd angles thanks to Apple's use of wide-angle OLED display technology.\n\nThe watch is available in a 42mm and 46mm case size. There are also new case finishes and materials, too, including lightweight titanium options, plus the Apple Watch 11 offers double the scratch resistance, which should better prevent damage to the display.\n\nDuring testing, we found the Apple Watch 11 was comfortable and easy to use. From tracking workouts to messaging friends to navigating cities to monitoring sleep, the Series 11 is extremely easy to use and interact with. Speaking of sleep, this is one of the first Apple Watch models with Apple's new sleep score.\n\nThe device ships running  watchOS 26 . This latest software delivers a new  Workout Buddy feature , which is practically an AI coach on your wrist, and hypertension alerts. It also showcases Apple's latest Liquid Glass design.\n\nThe Series 11 also boasts a bump from LTE to 5G connectivity, for better connection on the go. All of this adds up to the best Apple Watch for most people, and also the best smartwatch for iPhone users overall.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nWith the launch of the  Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 , it's now easy to find the Galaxy Watch 7 on sale for a sizable discount, and when it comes to sleep tracking insights, the Watch 7 is a match with the Watch 8.\n\nEven though the newer model offers a few new holistic tools, like cardiovascular load tracking and an antioxidant measuring tool (of questionable usefulness), in our opinion, these aren't life-changing enough to warrant the higher price tag. Here's a detailed comparison of the  Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 7 .\n\nNot only is the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 our top pick for sleep tracking, it's also the best full-featured smartwatch for Android users on a budget, thanks to a whole suite of impressive AI-underpinned wellness features beyond sleep-related ones, a lightweight and comfortable design, and tons of useful smart features.\n\nSleep insights are provided after only one night of use, unlike the competition, and they are both elaborate and digestible, with details on your sleep cycles, warnings for signs of snoring, detection for sleep apnea, and more. However, my favorite feature on the Galaxy Watch 7 has to be Samsung's Energy Score metric, which is updated daily and takes into account sleep quality, recent workouts, overall health trends, and more to help better understand your body's abilities and limitations.\n\nAvailable in 40 and 44mm, the Galaxy Watch 7 represents the last generation with Samsung's older circular case design; the newer Galaxy Watch 8 sports a more rectangular cushion case. Battery life is good for roughly 24 hours using the always-on display and 40 hours in power-save mode, which is par for the course.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe Google Pixel Watch 3 comes in both a 41mm and 45mm variant and you'll want to opt for the larger model to get the most out of this easy-wearing and fairly sleek-looking device. It's not quite as thin as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 nor is it as light, but the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 offers nearly double the battery life of its Samsung rival, making it the best Android smartwatch overall.\n\nThe 41mm Pixel Watch 3, on the other hand, lasts for closer to 24 hours (like the Galaxy Watch 7). However, both Pixel Watch models benefit from a thinner bezel compared to the  Pixel Watch 2 , and an upgraded screen that's easier to see in bright sunlight. Here are even more details on how the  Pixel Watch 3 vs. Pixel Watch 2  stack up.\n\nGoogle's health and fitness tools are largely on par with Samsung's with details into sleep quality and exercise, insights into workout recovery, menstrual health tracking and more. Google also unveiled a first-of-its-kind loss of pulse detection feature that works similarly to fall/crash detection, alerting help when triggered. While it's already available in most European markets, Google had to wait for FDA approval \u2014  which it has now secured  \u2014 to roll out Loss of Pulse Detection in the U.S. at the end of March 2025.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 3 additionally inherits some of Fitbit's best training metrics to help users better understand their day-to-day wellness and heart health, while avoiding overtraining. These include Fitbit's Readiness score, Cardio Load metric and Target Load score. There are also new metrics for hardcore runners to help improve form.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe Apple Watch SE 3 represents an exceptional value and is the best affordable smartwatch you can buy right now. The $249 device doesn't have all the latest bells and whistles found in the Ultra 3 or Series 11 but it still stands out for its great fitness tracking and safety features. It also comes with optional 5G for on-the-go connectivity without the need to carry a paired smartphone.\n\nBest of all, the Apple Watch SE 3 is compatible with the latest watchOS 26 software, which unlocks a host of new features including Apple's useful sleep score.\n\nUnlike the Series 11 and Ultra 3, the SE doesn't offer as bright or large a display. Users also miss out on an ECG monitor and skin temperature sensor.\n\nHowever, if those features aren't deal-breakers for you, the SE 3 is a highly capable option for iPhone users. It's also Cupertino's smallest and easiest-wearing Apple Watch, particularly the 40mm option, something folks with petite wrists can surely appreciate.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe Garmin Venu 3 is one of the  best Garmin watches  because it's both a capable workout companion and a stylish lifestyle device.\n\nThe combo also makes it the best smartwatch for fitness enthusiasts. Maintaining Garmin\u2019s reputation for thorough workout tracking and accurate GPS, the Venu 3 also offers the smarts of mirrored notifications and an on-wrist voice assistant.\n\nAnd even though Garmin still lacks a large third-party app store and continues to steer clear of LTE support, the Venu 3 has other smart features up its sleeve, like Garmin Pay for contactless payments and onboard storage capacity for music. You can also make and receive calls from the wrist, assuming your paired phone is near.\n\nWhile tracking workouts, Incident Detection works similarly to Apple's Fall Detection for safety. And, an abundance of sports profiles, helpful recovery time suggestions and on-watch interval creation keep you tuned into your activity, too.\n\nThe device additionally features nap-tracking and a nifty sleep coach feature to keep tabs on your rest while daily summaries offer behavioral insights. What's more with a 26-hour battery life in GPS mode and 15 days in smartwatch mode, you rarely need to stress about keeping the Garmin Venu 3 charged. It also comes in two easy-wearing sizes.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nOur pick for the  best running smartwatch  is the Garmin Forerunner 265. This lightweight wearable gives you everything you\u2019d want in a running watch, from accurate tracking to music controls to the ability to create custom workouts, for about the price of an Apple Watch Series 10. The device also offers access to Garmin\u2019s wide range of training metrics, which help you not only plan workouts but also calculate recovery time.\n\nDuring testing, we found the Garmin Forerunner 265's beautiful AMOLED display to be bright and easy to read, even in direct sunlight. The display is also touch-sensitive, which makes it easy to navigate. However, there are plenty of buttons along the side of the case if you prefer physical controls. The battery is long enough to last through a few workouts, even with music playing.\n\nThe Forerunner 265 has inherited some of the more advanced health features usually reserved for Garmin\u2019s more expensive running watches. It can also track complex multisport training sessions in the triathlon mode and features Garmin's extremely useful Training Readiness Score.\n\nWe test a lot of smartwatches here at Tom's Guide, but ultimately, some of our favorite models aren't cut out for inclusion above. This can be for a variety of reasons, or just one.\n\nTake the Apple Watch Ultra 2. It's a fantastic smartwatch, but it costs $799. This is too much coin to comfortably recommend, especially when the Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399 and is nearly as good.\n\nApple Watch Ultra 2 The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the brand's longest-lasting wearable, averaging 36 hours of battery per charge (70 hours in low-power mode). It's also the most durable Apple Watch, with 100 meters of water resistance, compared to 50 meters on the other models. But, with a starting price twice that of the newer Apple Watch Series 10, most folks would be better off purchasing the latter. Not only does the Series 10 have all the same features as the Ultra 2, but it's lighter and thinner, too.\n\nRead our  Apple Watch Ultra 2 review\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is the brand's newest smartwatch. Like the Galaxy Watch 7, it comes in 40mm and 44mm; however, there's also a 46mm Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with a rotating bezel. Of the new models, this is the one we recommend most, thanks to the clicky bezel, an extra (programmable) button, and better battery life (roughly 42 hours per charge). Compared to the Galaxy Watch 7, in addition to some new holistic tools, the newer model boasts Google's Gemini AI built in. Of course, this feature is slated to eventually come to the Galaxy Watch 7, which remains our top Samsung pick. Here's a closer look at the  Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 7 .\n\nRead our  Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 review\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra  The Galaxy Watch Ultra is Samsung's toughest-built, longest-lasting smartwatch with up to two days of battery per charge. Feature-wise, it's essentially a match with the newer Galaxy Watch 8 (and not that different from the Galaxy Watch 7). However, if you don't mind the added cost and appreciate a larger screen and beefier design, then the Galaxy Watch Ultra is worth a look.\n\nRead our  Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra review\n\nOnePlus Watch 3 The OnePlus Watch 3 is a bold and stylish smartwatch for Android users with better battery life than the Pixel Watch 3, Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra: up to five days per charge. It also offers comprehensive fitness tracking and works with a useful range of Wear OS apps. However, there's no support for cellular service or common safety features like crash detection and sleep apnea monitoring. Sizing is limited to just 46.6mm, which is fairly large.\n\nRead our  OnePlus Watch 3 review\n\nAt Tom's Guide, we've been assessing smartwatches since the debut of the very  first Apple Watch  a decade ago. Over the years, as devices have gotten more advanced, particularly regarding fitness and wellness features, our testing has become more rigorous.\n\nIt all starts with setting up the smartwatch just like we would any other shiny new piece of tech. Once properly fitted and secured, the fun begins: that smartwatch follows us everywhere we go, from early-morning workouts to late nights on the town and everything in between.\n\nAll the while, we're measuring how its battery life claims stack up in real-world use. We're also assessing comfort, usability, build quality and any new apps or features. Sometimes this means going for an  ocean swim with the latest Apple Watch  or  climbing a literal mountain  with three popular smartwatches in tow. Other times it means  hitting the slopes  with our favorite Polar watch or  biking up the steepest hill  in town wearing a Garmin.\n\nTo test fitness-tracking accuracy, we also frequently pit the best smartwatch models against one another while taking on workout challenges like runs, hikes, bike rides and more, because who doesn't love a showdown of the  Pixel Watch 3 vs. Galaxy Watch 7  or  Apple Watch SE vs. Garmin Forerunner 165 ?\n\nThese challenges help us understand things like which models excel at GPS precision, measuring a user's rapidly changing heart rate, counting your steps and calculating elevation changes.\n\nIn addition to testing fitness features, we also try any onboard safety features, including tools that monitor for sleep apnea and irregular heartbeats. If there's an app store, we'll install the most popular third-party apps to see how that changes the experience of the watch.\n\nFinally, we consider how a device stacks up against the competition in terms of cost, features, tech and design. All of this then gets distilled into a product review and ultimately, this buying guide.\n\nChoosing the  right smartwatch  for you all comes down to what you want the device to do. If you're looking for a wearable that can function as an extension of your smartphone, then options from Apple \u2014 if you're an iOS person \u2014 and Google or Samsung \u2014 if you're an Android person \u2014 are going to suit you best.\n\nSamsung's smartwatches are some of the most versatile for Android owners, as they'll work with most Android phones, although certain features are locked exclusively to the latest Samsung smartphones. Similarly, some of the newest Apple Watch features, like  AI-generated message summaries , require the latest/greatest handsets.\n\nWhichever full-featured smartwatch model you choose, springing for the latest version will likely mean you're getting the brightest display, fastest processor, and newest health tech.\n\nThe other main type of smartwatch is fitness-focused models from brands like Garmin, Polar and Coros. These devices don't offer the hearty buffet of third-party apps found on the aforementioned, nor do they come with loads of built-in smart features, but that's by design.\n\nInstead, you tend to get comparably more advanced training tools, metrics and insights than what you'll find on the latest Apple, Google or Samsung watch. And while you won't be able to answer a phone call or order a pizza, many of the  best Garmin watches   will  mirror your smartphone notifications while supporting lifestyle features including tap-to-pay and wrist-based music control for a connected device.\n\nOnce you've narrowed your best smartwatch choice down to either a full-featured or fitness-focu", "excerpt": "These are the best smartwatches in 2025, from affordable gems to fitness-focused flagships\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.
