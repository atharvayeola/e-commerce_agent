These are Apple's highest-end iPhones with the best possible feature set and camera technology.\n\nStarting at $1,099 for the Pro and $1,199 for the Pro Max, the iPhone 17 Pro models are more expensive than the $999 iPhone Air and the $799 iPhone 17, but they have the most advanced feature set available in the iPhone line.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are Apple's latest  high-end flagship smartphones  that Apple is selling alongside the iPhone Air and the iPhone 17. The iPhone 17 Pro models are Apple's  most advanced smartphones , with a bigger display option, more cameras, and higher performance than other models.\n\nApple  updated the design  of the iPhone 17 Pro models, but  display sizes haven't changed . The iPhone 17 Pro has a  6.3-inch display , and the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a  6.9-inch display . Both of the iPhone 17 Pro models are just a  little bit thicker ,  taller , and  wider  than the iPhone 16 Pro models, and that's because Apple  changed the internal structure .\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max feature a  unibody aluminum frame  for the first time, with Apple ditching titanium to go back to aluminum. Aluminum is lighter than titanium, and it is also  better at heat dispersion . The aluminum frame  covers almost all of the sides of the iPhone , the camera area, and the back, with the exception of a  cutout for MagSafe charging .\n\nThe camera bump is now called the  camera plateau , and it is a horizontal, rectangular raised area that spans nearly the entire rear of the iPhone. It houses the  three-lens camera setup  on the left, and the LiDAR Scanner and flash on the right. Apple changed the  antenna band location  to wrap around the plateau, so there are  no more antenna lines  on the edges of the phone and the antennas  perform better than before . Apple says the plateau provides more space for internal components, allowing for a larger battery.\n\nThe  MagSafe cutout at the back  of the iPhone is crafted from its  Ceramic Shield material  that's  more durable than glass , and Apple says it is 4\u00d7 more  resistant to cracks . The Ceramic Shield cutout is a slightly different color than the aluminum of the iPhone, giving the iPhone 17 Pro models  a two-tone look . Prior to now, recent iPhones had a full glass back rather than an aluminum and Ceramic Shield back.\n\nOn the front, the size of the Dynamic Island hasn't changed, and there are still  Camera Control and Action buttons . The  Action button  can be set to  multiple functions  such as launching the camera, turning on Flashlight, recording a Voice Memo, or activating a Shortcut. The  Camera Control  activates the Camera app. It is  touch and pressure sensitive  and can capture photos and videos, as well as  adjust camera settings .\n\nThere's a  USB-C port  at the bottom for charging, and it supports  USB3 transfer speeds . You can get the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max in  Cosmic Orange ,  Silver , or  Deep Blue  colors.\n\nApple used an upgraded  Ceramic Shield 2  to  protect the display , and it offers  3\u00d7 better scratch resistance  than the original Ceramic Shield. 120Hz  ProMotion  refresh rates are supported, but that's no longer a Pro-only feature. The iPhone 17 Pro models support  3,000 nits peak brightness  when outdoors, up from 2,000, and there is a new  anti-reflective display coating  to cut down on glare.  Outdoor contrast is 2\u00d7 better  than before.  1-nit minimum brightness  is available for the  Always-On display .\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models have an  A19 Pro  chip that's built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process. The A19 Pro includes a  6-core CPU  with two performance cores and four efficiency cores, and a  6-core GPU . Each core has a  Neural Accelerator  that Apple says improves tasks like on-device AI. There's an  updated 16-core Neural Engine , second-generation  dynamic caching , a  larger cache , and  12GB RAM .\n\nThe aluminum frame  improves thermal performance , but Apple also added a  vapor chamber cooling system  that uses a small amount of deionized water to move heat away from the A19 Pro and distribute it along the aluminum chassis. As a result, the A19 Pro offers  up to 40 percent faster sustained performance  than the A18 Pro.\n\nFor the first time, the iPhone 17 Pro  cameras are all 48 megapixels . There's a Main lens, an Ultra Wide angle lens, and the  new Telephoto lens  that supports both  4\u00d7 optical zoom and 8\u00d7 optical zoom , along with  40\u00d7 digital zoom . All three cameras support  4K video recording , and Apple also added support for  ProRes RAW video , Log 2 video recording, and Genlock support for professionals. An updated  Photonic Engine  uses machine learning to reduce noise, improve color accuracy, and increase detail.\n\nApple added a new  Dual Capture feature  that lets you record with the front and back cameras at the same time, and there is an  18-megapixel Center Stage front camera  with improved stabilization and new features.\n\nThe front-facing camera lets you take a selfie photo in  portrait or landscape mode  without rotating your phone, and it supports Center Stage for video calls and images with multiple people.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models have  major improvements to battery life . The iPhone 17 Pro battery  lasts for up to 33 hours  when watching videos, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max battery  lasts for up to 39 hours . Apple says the iPhone 17 Pro Max has the longest battery life ever in an iPhone.\n\nCharging is faster  than before, and the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max can reach  50 percent battery  in a  20-minute period  with the appropriate charger.  MagSafe  and  Qi2.2 charging  at  up to 25W  are supported. Versions of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max with an  eSIM  instead of a physical SIM have  larger batteries , and Apple is expanding the availability of  eSIM-only models  to more countries.\n\nBoth models  start with 256GB of storage , and the iPhone 17 Pro Max now supports up to  2TB of storage  but it costs $2,000.\n\nApple is still using  Qualcomm 5G modems  for the iPhone 17 Pro models, but they are now equipped with an  Apple-designed N1 networking chip . The N1 chip supports  Wi-Fi 7 ,  Bluetooth 6 , and  Thread , plus it improves efficiency for better battery life. The N1 chip also improves the  performance and reliability  of  Personal Hotspot  and  AirDrop .\n\nNote:  See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback?  Send us an email here .\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models can be purchased from Apple retail stores, the online Apple Store, and other major retailers and carriers  Pricing  on the iPhone 17 Pro  starts at $1,099 , so it is $100 more expensive than the iPhone 16 Pro, but it comes with a minimum of 256GB of storage rather than 128GB. Pricing on the iPhone 17 Pro Max still starts at $1,199.\n\nReviewers were impressed with the iPhone 17 Pro's updated thermal design, which features vapor chamber cooling and an aluminum unibody. Gaming was smoother with more frames per second, and while the device still got hot, it was more uniformly spread than the iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nplay\n\nThe drop to 4\u00d7 zoom from 5\u00d7 zoom was barely noticeable to reviewers, but the 8\u00d7 zoom 200mm option was praised for providing more available range. 8\u00d7 images in low lighting conditions had more noise and softness than 4\u00d7 images, though.\n\nplay\n\nBattery life was another major talking point in reviews, because the iPhone 17 Pro models offer up to six hours more battery life than the iPhone 16 Pro models in Apple's metrics. In practice, reviewers saw an hour or two longer battery life with a heavy runtime load.\n\nMore iPhone 17 Pro reviews can be  found in our review roundup .\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models come in two sizes. The standard Pro model has a 6.3-inch display, and the larger Pro Max has a 6.9-inch display. Display sizing did not change this year, but there are some minor differences in device thickness due to a revised design.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro is 5.91 inches tall (150mm), 2.83 inches wide (71.9mm), and 8.75mm thick, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max is 6.43 inches tall (163.4mm), 3.07 inches wide (78mm), and 8.75mm thick. Both of the iPhone 17 Pro models are thicker than the iPhone 16 Pro models, which were 8.25mm thick.\n\nWeight has increased, and the iPhone 17 Pro weighs 206 grams, up from 199 grams. The iPhone 17 Pro Max weighs 233 grams, up from 227 grams.\n\nRather than using titanium like the iPhone 16 Pro models, the iPhone 17 Pro models have an aluminum unibody casing. Most of the iPhone is aluminum, with the exception of a cutout at the back for MagSafe charging. The back cutout uses Ceramic Shield, Apple's glass-ceramic hybrid material. Prior versions of the iPhone had glass at the back, but Ceramic Shield is much more resistant to breaking.\n\nThere is a color and material difference between the aluminum frame of the iPhone 17 Pro and the Ceramic Shield 2 cutout, giving the iPhone 17 Pro models a two-tone look.\n\nApple only created 3 colors for the iPhone 17 Pro Max models: Cosmic Orange, Deep Blue, and Silver. Cosmic Orange is the brightest color that Apple has offered for the Pro line, and there is no black or gray option for the first time.\n\nDespite the new aluminum frame, the iPhone 17 Pro's design hasn't changed a lot. From the front, it looks identical to the iPhone 16 Pro. There is a clear difference at the back, though, because Apple redesigned the camera bump. Rather than a square bump in the left corner of the iPhone, there's now a raised \"camera plateau\" that spans across most of the upper back of the device.\n\nThere continue to be three cameras arranged in a triangle shape, but the True Tone flash and the LiDAR sensor have been moved over to the right of the plateau. Adding a longer raised area at the back of the iPhone allowed Apple to include a larger battery in the iPhone 17 Pro models.\n\nThe antenna bands that used to be visible at the sides of the iPhone have been moved. The antenna now wraps around the camera plateau, a design that minimizes the antenna's visibility and increases cellular signal.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro has all of the same design features as the iPhone 16 Pro, including volume buttons and an Action button on the left, and a power button and Camera Control on the right. The bottom features a USB-C charging port with a microphone and speaker holes on either side of it.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max have an IP68 rating for resistance to water and dust intrusion. The smartphones are able to withstand a depth of up to six meters (19.7 feet) for up to 30 minutes.\n\nIn the IP68 number, the 6 refers to dust resistance (and means the iPhone 16 can hold up to dirt, dust, and other particulates), while the 8 pertains to water resistance. IP6X is the highest dust resistance rating that exists. With the IP68 rating, the iPhone 16 can withstand splashes, rain, and accidental water exposure, but intentional water exposure should be avoided.\n\nWater and dust resistance are not permanent conditions, according to Apple, and can deteriorate over time as a result of normal wear. Apple's standard warranty does not cover liquid damage, which means it's best to use caution when it comes to liquid exposure.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models continue to feature a customizable Action button above the volume buttons. Here's what it can do:\n\nActivating the Action button is done with a long press, preventing it from being hit accidentally.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models include the Camera Control on the right side. The button is used for capturing images and video, and it is designed to behave like the shutter button on a DSLR camera. There's a force sensor and a touch sensor, so while a single press opens the Camera app, there are also swipe gestures to change tools.\n\nA sapphire crystal with a smooth texture covers the Camera Control, and it is inset into the iPhone's frame so it isn't activated accidentally. The included force sensor has haptic feedback to provide gesture feedback.\n\nThe button includes software support, so you can also swap between Camera Control functions without having to adjust settings in the Camera app. These features can be turned off in the Settings app if you are activating them accidentally.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro has a 6.3-inch display with a 2622\u00d71206 resolution at 460 pixels per inch, while the larger iPhone 17 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch display with a 2868\u00d71320 resolution at 460 pixels per inch.\n\nA pill-shaped Dynamic Island is at the top of the display, and 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates are included as usual. ProMotion offers higher frame rates for smooth scrolling, video games, and videos.\n\nOutdoor brightness has increased this year, now peaking at 3,000 nits, up from 2,000. Peak HDR brightness is 1,600 nits, and peak typical brightness is 1,000 nits. 1-nit brightness is the minimum, enabling Always-On display technology.\n\nP3 Wide Color provides vivid, true-to-life color, while True Tone support matches the white balance of the display to the ambient lighting in the room to reduce eyestrain. There's a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio, with HDR support.\n\nApple upgraded the display with Ceramic Shield 2, a material that offers 3\u00d7 better scratch resistance than the prior version of Ceramic Shield. Ceramic Shield is glass that has ceramic nano crystals embedded in it to improve durability.\n\nWith Ceramic Shield 2, an Apple-designed anti-reflective coating has been added on top to reduce scratching and cut down on glare.\n\nThe Dynamic Island includes the TrueDepth camera sensor for Face ID and the front-facing camera. The display has a small circular cutout on the right side that's for the camera, and a pill-shaped cutout on the left side for the TrueDepth system for Face ID. Apple uses software to combine the two cutouts into one pill-shaped cutout that makes up the Dynamic Island.\n\nApple turned the Dynamic Island into part of the iPhone's interface, and it is used as a front-and-center information hub for notifications and other at-a-glance information from apps and services. When you make an Apple Pay payment, for example, Dynamic Island expands into a square shape to show confirmation of your Face ID scan, and when on a phone call, it expands so you have phone controls at your fingertips.\n\nThe Dynamic Island can display everything from Maps directions to Apple Music, and it integrates with Live Activities. There are no changes to the Dynamic Island with the iPhone 17 Pro models.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models use Face ID, Apple's facial recognition system. Face ID is part of the Dynamic Island.\n\nFace ID is used across iOS for unlocking the iPhone, allowing access to passcode-protected apps, confirming app purchases, authenticating Apple Pay payments, and more.\n\nFace ID works through a set of sensors and cameras. A Dot Projector projects tens of thousands of invisible infrared dots onto the surface of the skin to create a 3D facial scan that maps the curves and planes of each face, with the scan read by an infrared camera.\n\nThe facial depth map is relayed to the A19 Pro chip where it is transformed into a mathematical model that the iPhone uses to authenticate identity. Face ID works in low light and in the dark, and with hats, beards, glasses, sunglasses, scarves, masks, and other accessories that partially obscure the face.\n\nThe Dynamic Island also includes an 18-megapixel front-facing camera that Apple added to this year's iPhones, an upgrade over the 12-megapixel camera in the prior-generation models. Apple is calling the new selfie camera the \"Center Stage\" front camera.\n\nThe Center Stage camera has the first square camera sensor on an iPhone, and it provides a wider field of view that can capture more detail, so you can now take a portrait or landscape selfie while holding your phone vertically. You can simply tap on an icon in the camera app to change the photo orientation.\n\nFor group shots with the front-facing camera, Center Stage uses AI to expand the field of view and can rotate from portrait to landscape to fit everyone in the shot.\n\nThe camera supports ultra-stabilized video in 4K HDR, and there is an option to record with the front and rear cameras simultaneously using the new Dual Capture feature. During video calls, Center Stage works to keep you stable and in the frame.\n\nThe front-facing camera also supports 4K video recording, QuickTake video, Night mode, Smart HDR 5 integration, Dolby Vision HDR recording, Deep Fusion to bring out fine details, a Photonic Engine that improves low-light performance, Photographic Styles, and a portrait feature that lets you take images and turn them into portrait shots later.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models include the higher-end version of Apple's A19 Pro chip with a 6-core CPU and a 6-core GPU. The 6-core CPU features two performance cores and six efficiency cores, while the 6-core GPU includes Neural Accelerators built into each core to speed up gaming and AI tasks. Apple also improved the GPU with a larger 32MB cache and more memory, so it offers 3\u00d7 more peak GPU compute compared to the A19 Pro. The A19 Pro features 16MB of L2 cache for performance cores and 6MB for efficiency cores.\n\nApple built the A19 Pro chip on an upgraded third-generation 3-nanometer N3P process for modest speed and efficiency improvements. The chip includes a 16-core Neural Engine, next-generation dynamic caching, and unified image compression.\n\nThe A19 Pro is approximately 15 percent faster than the A18 Pro when it comes to single-core performance, and 20 percent faster for multi-core performance.\n\nApple overhauled the thermal design of the iPhone 17 Pro models, adopting a vapor chamber cooling system. With the vapor chamber system, a small amount of deionized water moves heat away from the A19 Pro chip and distributes it throughout the iPhone's aluminum unibody frame.\n\nApple says the design allows for 40 percent better sustained performance for demanding tasks.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models have 12GB RAM, up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro models.\n\nThe base iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models come with 256GB of storage, but there are 512GB and 1TB options, as well as a 2TB option only for the iPhone 17 Pro Max. This is the first time that Apple has offered a 2TB storage option for an iPhone.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max have three 48-megapixel lenses, a first for an iPhone. There's a 48-megapixel Fusion lens, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and a 48-megapixel Telephoto lens. Apple says that it's the best-ever camera system, featuring higher-resolution sensors.\n\nThe Fusion Main lens has an \u0192/1.78 aperture, a second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization, and support for 24-megapixel or 48-megapixel photos. There is an option for 12-megapixel 2\u00d7 Telephoto images using the Main lens.\n\nThere's a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and it has with an \u0192/2.2 aperture with a 120 degree field of view. Like the Fusion camera, Apple uses pixel binning to combine the data from four pixels into one pixel, allowing for images with more detail and a lens that performs better in low light. The Ultra Wide camera is also used for macro shots.\n\nThe 48-megapixel Telephoto lens is new, and it is an upgrade over the prior-generation 12-megapixel Telephoto lens. Apple says that the next-generation tetraprism design features a sensor that is 56 percent larger than the previous sensor to improve low-light performance.\n\nThe lens supports 4\u00d7 optical zoom at 100mm, and 8\u00d7 optical zoom at 200mm. The 4\u00d7 images are 48 megapixels, while the 8\u00d7 images are ", "excerpt": "play\n\nSubscribe for regular MacRumors news and future  iPhone 17 Pro   info.\n\nIntroduced in September 2025, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are Apple's newest flagship iPhones and  now is a good time to buy .\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models feature Apple's most significant Pro model update in years, with a unibody aluminum chassis and a vapor chamber cooling system to maximize the performance of the A19 Pro chip.\n\nThere's a 48-megapixel triple-lens camera system featuring a new Telephoto lens ", "meta": {"og": {"title": "iPhone 17 Pro:  Everything We Know | MacRumors", "image": "https://images.macrumors.com/t/myq0N5iVZ0Q9DG_s0E_XejgPgdY=/1600x/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-pro-orange.jpg"}, "json_ld": [{"@context": "https://schema.org/", "@type": "NewsArticle", "articleSection": "Apple News", "inLanguage": "en-US", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/"}, "headline": "iPhone 17 Pro", "image": [{"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://images.macrumors.com/t/7Ho32XUzFI0iMuI_hbVi6JyVu7A=/1600x0/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-pro-orange.jpg", "width": 1600, "height": 898}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://images.macrumors.com/t/wm7fEofMl899j0TdHzdoOMmVWu8=/1600x900/smart/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-pro-orange.jpg", "width": 1600, "height": 900}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://images.macrumors.com/t/teJHu3lcNpPzetEZP566lXmWyFE=/1600x1200/smart/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-pro-orange.jpg", "width": 1600, "height": 1200}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://images.macrumors.com/t/opHMo_uvYicgHqxDA37LK3_U8ZA=/1200x1200/smart/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-pro-orange.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 1200}], "datePublished": "2025-02-13T14:44:56-08:00", "dateModified": "2025-10-07T16:26:33-07:00", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Juli Clover", "sameAs": "https://twitter.com/julipuli", "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "MacRumors", "description": "Apple News and Apple Rumors", "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://images.macrumors.com/images-new/macrumors-amp-logo.png", "width": 394, "height": 60}}, "description": "Should You Buy the iPhone 17 Pro?
