The shoes you choose make  all  the difference. The wrong pair of shoes will end up rotting away at the back of your closet \u2014 but the  right  pair of shoes makes running a freeing experience.\n\nSince 2011, we have intensely tested over 600 pairs of men's and women's road-specific running shoes, logging thousands of miles in all kinds of weather. Our expert testing team includes  USA Track & Field certified coaches ,  running biomechanics experts ,  trained exercise specialists , and  ultra-distance top-10 finalists . We actually run  over 50 miles in every single pair  \u2014 on roads, down paths, and around tracks \u2014 so that we can confidently tell you what pair of trainers is going to help you meet  your  specific needs and goals.\n\nOur entire testing team agrees that, hands down, the  Asics Novablast 5  is the best road shoe for just about every runner. Its cushy foam, lightweight feeling, and springy forefoot make it excel at any running style, speed, and ability. It's one of the few pairs our testers continue to reach for after official testing is over \u2014 and costs a lot less than most of the competition.\n\nFor bargain hunters, the best sale deal  right now  for women is still the  Saucony Kinvara 14 , which is a versatile and simple, well-loved shoe that, despite being two iterations behind, is still widely available for around 55% off. For men, the best deal under $100 is the  New Balance FuelCell Propel v5 , which offers great do-it-all performance and is currently marked down 20-40% in many colors and sizes on Amazon.\n\nIf you're after a light jog interspersed with walking, many of the pairs in our  walking shoe lineup  could be an excellent fit for your needs.\n\nEditor's Note: On August 14, we added additional information from extended testing, updated our recommendations to reflect new data and availability, and revised our list with shoes we're currently testing.\n\n$150  at REI Compare at 2 sellers\n\n$116  at Amazon Compare at 2 sellers\n\n$112  at Backcountry Compare at 3 sellers\n\n$97  at Amazon\n\n$70  at Amazon\n\n$140  at REI Compare at 2 sellers\n\n$140  at Amazon Compare at 3 sellers\n\n$150  at Backcountry Compare at 3 sellers\n\n$250  at Amazon\n\nWho it's best for:  Both our  men's  and  women's  testing teams  adore  this shoe and recommend it for every kind of runner. If you're just getting started running, this shoe boosts confidence in every stride. If you're training for a big race or a long-distance event, you'll love that it's highly cushioned, with all-day comfort. Lead tester Nathaniel Bailey attests, \u201c As a high school coach, I recommend this shoe for basically everyone. Heel and midfoot strikers love the cushioning, and forefoot runners appreciate the smooth, snappy transitions .\u201d\n\nWhy we love it:  The  Novablast 5  shines for its top-tier comfort and versatility at a reasonable price, making it a consistent training partner. Lead tester and exercise specialist Ally Acuri says, \u201c I'm obsessed with how this shoe hits the sweet spot of having enough support to keep my tired legs pumping on hard runs, but never feeling restrictive or stiff underfoot. It can handle easy mileage and faster paces while remaining comfortable. If I had to choose just one shoe for all my miles, this is the one I'd pick .\u201d\n\nShould you buy it?  This is the do-it-all shoe we recommend to all our friends, even in direct comparison to dozens of other current pairs we've tested and even before considering its lower-than-average price. The  Novablast's  only minor downside is mediocre traction on cold, wet pavement. But with updates to the  5  \u2014 like bouncier foam, lower weight, and improved traction \u2014 this shoe has got what it takes to make pretty much anyone's running experience better.\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop:  9 mm |  Weight:  7.3 oz/shoe (women's 6.5)\n\nRead more:   Women's Asics Novablast 5 review\n\nWho it's best for:  The  New Balance Fresh Foam X More v5  is perfect for runners seeking a pillowy, cushioned ride and optimal joint protection. It excels at slow-and-steady paces, during long runs, and through high-mileage weeks. Its thick stack under the heel is ideal for runners who often experience knee or hip pain from repeated impact. Exercise specialist and our lead women's tester, Ally Arcuri, gushes, \" This shoe  is a dream come true for easy-going paces and recovery runs.\"\n\nWhy we love it:  This shoe delivers unmatched cushioning with a smooth rocker shape that feels natural in motion \u2014 not chunky, like some high-cushion shoes \u2014 with soft, squishy soles. It also has a wide platform and sturdy sidewalls that make it one of the most stable high-stack pairs around. Track coach and lead tester Nathaniel Bailey confessed, \u201c This is one of my favorites for short, easy mileage. Even right after race day, when my legs are the most sore, these plush shoes are satisfyingly insulating but still keep me rolling along rather than tiredly plodding .\u201d\n\nShould you buy it?  If you're after a comfortable shoe for logging easy miles and bringing your joints relief, this is absolutely worth it. Other shoes with this level of comfort cost  far  more and aren't nearly as stable as the  More v5 .\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop:  5 mm |  Weight:  8.6 oz/shoe (women's 6.5)\n\nRead more:   Women's New Balance Fresh Foam X More v5 review\n\nWho it's best for:  The  Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24  improves upon the last version with even better medial and lateral support, offering the most stable ride on the market. It's a reliable shoe that cushions and supports, giving a neutral and comfortable ride to those who may struggle to find that in other shoes.\n\nWhy we love it:  With a thick stack that cushions and protects, the  Adrenaline GTS  maintains a firm enough ride to easily eat up daily miles. It has noticeable medial support, helping runners who have a tendency to collapse inward through their stride. Though it's not built for speed, it feels plush and helps us eat up recovery miles with a smile.\n\nShould you buy it?  If you're after a thick, comfortable stack that doesn't make you feel like you're balancing on top of stilts, this laterally stable pair of shoes is right up your alley. If you want to zone out while covering long miles at low paces, the  Adrenaline GTS 24  is a great choice.\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop:  13 mm |  Weight:  10.7 oz/shoe (men's 10.5)\n\nRead more:   Men's Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24 review\n\nWho it is best for:  The  New Balance FuelCell Propel v5  is ideal for average-paced runners focusing on day-to-day mileage with easy to moderate effort. It's a solid pick for those seeking a budget-friendly shoe with plush cushioning and stability for long runs. Track coach and lead tester Nathaniel Bailey notes, \u201c I really appreciate the soft foam underfoot on my long runs at middling speeds .\u201d\n\nWhy we love it:  This pair offers solid across-the-board performance with above-average cushioning, reasonable comfort, and a TPU plate for directional stability. The FuelCell foam, typically found in higher-end models, enhances confidence on longer runs, while the soft upper and sturdy, grippy outsole improve fit and traction on wet surfaces or gravel. At 15-45% off retail on Amazon, the Propel v5's build quality and value are hard to beat.\n\nShould you buy it?  This is a comfortable, well-made choice for casual, regular runs, especially at its discounted price. However, its slightly above-average weight and average responsiveness may disappoint runners chasing faster paces or PRs. If speed is your goal, consider other options, but this shoe delivers everything you need for reliable, plush daily runs on a budget.\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop : 7 mm |  Weight : 10.5 oz/shoe (men's 10.5)\n\nRead more:   Men's New Balance FuelCell Propel v5 review\n\nWho it is best for:  The  Saucony Kinvara 14  is perfect for runners seeking a lightweight, versatile shoe for uptempo daily runs on a budget. It's ideal for those who value ground feel and a responsive, organic ride, with lead women's tester Ally Arcuri noting, \u201c This is actually one of my favorite shoes for uptempo running when I still want to feel the ground under my feet. \u201d Available at up to 50% off, it suits budget-conscious runners who prioritize performance.\n\nWhy we love it:  The Kinvara 14 delivers impressive versatility and comfort with its slightly soft foam and peppy energy return, offering a bouncy yet grounded ride. As exercise specialist and lead tester Ally Arcuri puts it, \u201c Running in these reminds me of the great, responsive shoes from a decade ago before everyone had access to super shoes, \u201d and adds, \u201c This shoe is bouncy enough to provide some energy return and feedback without feeling like I'm prancing on marshmallowy clouds. \u201d Lighter than most tested shoes, it outperforms pricier racing shoes in daily versatility.\n\nShould you buy it?  At up to 50% off, the Kinvara 14 is a compelling choice for runners wanting a high-performance, lightweight shoe for uptempo runs \u2014 nearly matching the newer  Kinvara 15 , which we also tested. However, its minimalistic design lacks the support some distance runners need, and its lower stack offers less cushioning.\n\nv15 Heel-to-Toe Drop:  3 mm |  Weight:  5.4 oz/shoe (women's 6.5)\n\nRead more:   Women's Saucony Kinvara 15 review\n\nWho it's best for:  The  Hoka Mach 6  is a shockingly lightweight high-performance shoe with a well-rounded performance that pretty much any runner will appreciate. It's a great shoe for everything from walking long days on vacation to picking up the pace during race training. With two widths to choose from, just about everyone can find a fit they love in this super versatile shoe.\n\nWhy we love it:  The smooth rocker of the  Mach 6  makes strides feel like they're flowing from one step to the next \u2014 no matter if we're plodding along on long, slow days or trying to hit a new PR. The midsole isn't the thickest around, but provides solid cushioning and an exciting level of pep in our steps. Lead tester and certified track coach Nathaniel Bailey logged well over 100 miles in his pair, without noticing any loss of pop \u2014 an impressive feat!\n\nShould you buy it?  If you want one shoe that can do it all \u2014 from being on your feet all day to crushing a marathon \u2014 the Mach 6 has that level of versatility. It's also one of the more reasonably priced options we've tested \u2014 and currently on sale on Hoka's website.\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop:  8 mm |  Weight:  8.7 oz/shoe (men's 10.5)\n\nRead more:   Men's Hoka Mach 6 review\n\nWho it's best for:  The  Saucony Ride 18  is a shoe that is designed for non-runners to be able to easily, comfortably, and happily find their joy in running. It has great underfoot cushioning, a comfortable upper, and a wide base that adds stability even for unstable strides. This reliable ride is a great choice for a lot of regular, low-mileage runners looking for an affordable option that's pleasant to run in, as well as folks searching for their very first pair of couch-to-5K shoes.\n\nWhy we love it:  Pretty much any runner with any stride can find comfort and enjoyment in the  Saucony Ride 18 . It gets all the fundamentals right without requiring you to change your patterns to match the shoe. As lead tester and cross country coach Nathaniel Bailey puts it, \u201c They have good cushioning, but I can still feel the ground \u2014 that's super helpful for people just learning their running pattern .\u201d\n\nShould you buy it?  If you're an infrequent runner, a new runner, or an old hat looking for a dependable shoe, this should be at the top of your list. And at a retail cost on the low end of the spectrum of good-quality shoes, this durable model is a great value purchase.\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop:  8 mm |  Weight:  7.5 oz/shoe (women's 6.5)\n\nRead more:   Women's Saucony Ride 18 review\n\nWho it's best for:  The underfoot cushioning of the  Nike Vomero 18  is particularly resilient to being crushed over time, making this an excellent shoe for anyone who feels their shoes are \u201c bottoming out \u201d after just a few dozen miles of running. Tall folks, big folks, and folks with heavy footsteps will especially appreciate the snappy rebound of this shoe.\n\nWhy we love it:  In addition to its hardiness, the  Vomero  just feels good to wear. Even our elite runners feel planted yet smooth running in this shoe. Its cushioning is soft without stealing all your stride energy, and its upper is comfortable and breathable. Though it's a bit heavy, our testing team agrees it's worth its weight.\n\nShould you buy it?  If you've tried other running shoes and found they lose their cushioning too quickly, the  Vomero  is for you. This shoe is also a great option for runners with heavy footfalls who want their cushioning to stay soft and springy.\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop:  11 mm |  Weight:  11.6 oz/shoe (men's 10.5)\n\nRead more:   Women's Nike Vomero 18 review\n\nWho it is best for:  The unisex  Asics Metaspeed Sky Paris  is the top choice for runners seeking a high-performance racing shoe that suits a wide range of foot morphologies and strike patterns. It's ideal for those chasing PRs or competing on race day, with lead women's tester Ally Arcuri reporting, \" The  Metaspeed Sky Paris  feels more natural on my feet than any other racing shoe. It's explosively fast, yet still comfortable for the long haul. \"\n\nWhy we love it:  This super shoe has one of the lowest weights of any shoe we've tested. Its high-energy return foam and carbon plate combine with a natural-feeling geometry, making it the fastest and most versatile racing model we've tested. Testers set PRs in it, with lead men's tester, coach Nathaniel Bailey, saying, \u201c I have many options available for race day \u2014 but I keep coming back to these. They just work so well. \u201d Its durability \u2014 over 300 miles so far \u2014 and comfort for long races further elevate its appeal.\n\nShould you buy it?  This is unmatched for the best all-around racing shoe, though its premium price may deter some. Unlike some shoes, which require adaptation and don't suit all runners, this shoe's design feels intuitive and broadly compatible. Our lead women's tester said, \u201c This shoe is as close to a universal racing shoe as I've seen. \u201d\n\nHeel-to-Toe Drop:  6 mm  |  Weight:  5.1 oz/shoe (women's 6.5)\n\nRead more:   Women's Asics Metaspeed Sky Paris review\n\nOur primary focus in testing running shoes is to run in them\u2026  a lot . Our male and female testers log dozens of miles in each pair of shoes and choose various terrain types to include in their routes. Collectively, our expert running shoe test team members have logged thousands of miles in close to  800 pairs of road and trail running shoes  and counting. When testing, we pay close attention to underfoot and upper comfort, stability, cushion, traction, and weight. In addition to running miles and miles in each shoe, we also buy a second pair of each shoe to perform a series of tests in our lab. These lab tests include cutting each shoe in half to precisely measure stack heights, heel-to-toe drop, rocker angle, weight, and more. Rather than trusting the manufacturer's measurements, we make all of our measurements, so every specification we share is collected in a careful apples-to-apples manner. Our lab testing is then combined with our primary focus on running in each shoe to create a complete 360 analysis of each shoe.\n\nOur main testers for this review include a collection of devoted runners with expertise in the sport, and most have spent years running and testing footwear for the GearLab team.  Ally Arcuri  is an avid runner and exercise specialist with a Cal State Fullerton kinesiology degree that helps her evaluate women's trail and road shoes from a biomechanical perspective.\n\nNathaniel Bailey  is the lead tester for our men's road shoe review. He competed in track and cross country from middle school through college and now continues to race on the roads and coach high school and recreational runners.\n\nWorld-class runner  Carrie Vickers  has an impressive resume of Olympic trial rankings, World Championship qualifications, and, for a time, held the record in the  2000 meter steeplechase . She is now a professional running biomechanics consultant who has helped inform our testing plans and advises those trying to find the right shoes for their bodies and goals in a sea of shoes.\n\nIn addition, our laboratory team of engineers cuts open every pair to take actual measurements, according to the  World Athletics guidelines , which are standardized in a way that manufacturer claims just aren't.\n\nIn this section, our expert shoe testers will walk you through a process to help you find the best shoe for your needs, whether you're a brand-new runner who wants to start on the right foot or a long-time runner looking for a new pair. We'll start by explaining how to assess a shoe's fit. Then, we'll consider how you plan to use the shoe. Finally, we'll delve into the different features you may want to consider.\n\nFit is  the most  important factor to consider when buying a new pair of shoes. The shoe that feels the most comfortable is the right shoe for you. If a shoe doesn't feel good, move on. There is even science-backed evidence that wearing  more comfortable shoes is associated with better running economy .\n\nYou will find that sizing isn't always consistent across brands. Some run large, and some run small. Some brands, like Puma and Hoka, are known for having narrow-fitting shoes, while others, like Altra and Topo Athletic, tend to have wide and roomy toe boxes. Because each model has a slightly different profile, we recommend purchasing shoes from a location where you can try them on first or going through a website with a good return policy. Several running shoe brands offer a 30-90-day trial of their shoes with free returns.\n\nTry on shoes at the time of day you normally run, and wear your favorite  running socks . Take them for a quick spin, and always try on  both  shoes (most people's feet are not the same size). Over time, you will likely dial in your preferences for everything from width to lacing patterns.\n\nManufacturers often make specific versions of their shoes for men and women, and you may wonder how different they can be. Is it worth seeking out a male or female-specific shoe? The answer is  maybe . Shoes designed for women are not always a smaller version of their men's counterparts. A few important design differences are made to accommodate the varying foot shapes, biomechanics, and support needs of men and women.\n\nTo start, the average woman is smaller and lighter than the average male, and women's shoes may have a softer midsole with a lighter wearer in mind. On average, men's shoes are wider than women's. However, women's shoes differ in the proportional width, generally featuring a narrower heel cup to help secure the back of the foot and a roomier forefoot to allow toes to splay naturally.\n\nOur men's road shoe testing team put each pair through more than 50 miles of long distances, hill sprints, speed workouts, and slow recovery runs. Here are the scores from  all  the shoes in our  current men's road running shoe lineup :\n\nSimilarly, our women's testing team uses the same testing plan, putting each shoe through the wringer over long miles and a diversity of paces, distances, and goals. Here are the scores across our complete lineup of  women's road running shoes :\n\nStart by thinking about where you run. Are you sticking to the pavement? Venturing into the mountains on rocky paths? Spending a lot of time on the treadmill?\n\nIf you plan to run off-road, onto uneven, rocky, or steep ground, trail shoes are a good fit for you. If not, skip down to the next section on road shoes.\n\nTrail running shoes have a more protective build, making them better suited for technical and rocky trails. Aggressive tread provides greater traction, features like rock plates help to protect your feet from underfoot hazards, and denser midsole foam and lower stack he", "excerpt": "It doesn't matter if you decided to take up running five minutes ago or have been jogging the streets for decades.
