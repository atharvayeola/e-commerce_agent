How we test 9.  Why trust Laptop Mag\n\nForget the myth that stellar laptops require exorbitant prices. I can find a fantastic laptop under $1,000 that doesn't sacrifice performance, battery life, or durability. In fact, some of these laptops also rank among the  best laptops  we\u2019ve tested overall.\n\nWith modern processors, many of which are  AI -powered, these sub-$1,000 laptops are well-rounded machines that offer great performance, solid battery life, and durable build quality. You don't have to sacrifice screen brightness or performance for battery life.\n\nThat said, there are multiple ways to narrow down your search and find the best laptop under $1,000 for your specific needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the most affordable option and primarily use the web, consider one of the  best Chromebooks  or the  best laptops under $500 . If you want the best performance possible for gaming on your laptop, you may need to accept a lower-quality display. Alternatively, consider upping your budget slightly and take a look at the  best gaming laptops under $1,500 .\n\nWhether you\u2019re searching for a budget-friendly laptop that\u2019ll last all day without charging, seamlessly handle your tendency to leave multiple tabs open, or help you unwind with AAA games in the evening, we\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nAfter thousands of hours testing and reviewing laptops this year, here are the best laptops under $1,000 in 2025.\n\nClick to view recent updates to this page\n\n6/16/2025:  Moved the  Acer  Swift Go 14 from Best Overall to Best  Windows ; added the  Apple   MacBook Air  13-inch M4 as the Best Overall pick; added the Acer Nitro 17 as the Best Gaming pick; added the  Samsung Galaxy  Chromebook Plus as the Best Chromebook pick; removed the  Asus  Zenbook 14 OLED (Q425M) as the Best Student pick\n\nSarah Chaney is a freelance tech writer with a bachelor's degree in English and five years of experience across multiple outlets, including Mashable, How-To Geek, MakeUseOf, Tom\u2019s Guide, and of course, Laptop Mag. As someone who reviews multiple laptops every year, Sarah knows which laptops offer the best specs, performance, and features for their price.

Find out more about how we test .\n\nAfter rigorous testing, we've compiled a list of the best laptops under $1,000. Our mini-reviews are linked to more extensive reviews, but you should get all of the information you need right here.\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe  Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M4  dips back to its old starting price of $999, making it one of the best value laptops you can find right now, with fantastic performance, long battery life, and great built-in features.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You want the best experience $1,000 will get you:  At just under $1,000 full price, the M4-powered MacBook Air is an amazing value. It\u2019ll last nearly two full work days without needing a charge, promises great performance, and offers a lovely keyboard, display, and webcam.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You need your laptop to be travel-friendly:  There\u2019s a reason Apple labels this laptop as the MacBook Air. It\u2019s incredibly light at 2.7 pounds and doesn\u2019t take up much space with its 13.6-inch display.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You want specific built-in ports:  In order to keep this laptop light and affordable, it has limited ports. There are two Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, an audio jack, and the MagSafe 3 charging port.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You\u2019re not a fan of the Apple ecosystem:  This may go without saying, but if you know you don\u2019t like Apple products, you probably won\u2019t like this laptop, no matter how many objectively great features it has.\n\nApple\u2019s MacBook Air 13-inch M4 is more powerful and long-lasting than its predecessor, and yet it\u2019s $100 cheaper. The latest M4-powered MacBook Air starts at just $999, and for that incredible price, you get a thin, lightweight laptop with fantastic performance, a gorgeous display, and over 15 hours of battery life.\n\nSean Riley writes, \u201cApple's MacBook Air 13-inch M4 is not a perfect laptop, but at its new starting price of $999, it is the perfect laptop for many people.\u201d\n\nDespite its affordable starting price (which often dips below $900 during sales), the MacBook Air 13 M4 is no slacker when it comes to performance. This laptop delivered a Geekbench 6 score of 14,849, which is a higher score than many of its more expensive competitors churned out. If your productive work days are full of so many  Chrome  tabs you lose count, this laptop can handle it with no issues and still manage to keep things cool.\n\nWhat makes the MacBook Air M4 one of the  best laptops  in general, not just one of the best laptops under $1,000, is that it doesn\u2019t ignore the finer details. Yes, this laptop offers incredible performance and battery life wrapped up in an easily portable chassis, but it also features an unmatched webcam, a bright, sharp display, decent speakers, and a lovely keyboard.\n\nTouching on the display a bit more, it\u2019s impressive to see a display on a sub-$1,000 laptop as premium as this one. This laptop features a 13.6-inch, 2560 x 1664 Liquid Retina LCD display that averaged 463 nits brightness in testing. It also covered 79.3% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, on par with other laptops in its category.\n\nFor all these reasons and then some, we\u2019d recommend the MacBook Air 13 M4 to anyone sticking to a strict budget of $1,000 or less. The only downside worth mentioning is the laptop\u2019s limited ports, but that can easily be fixed by adding one of the  best USB-C hubs  to your setup.\n\nSee our full  Apple MacBook Air 13-inch M4 review .\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe  Acer Swift Go 14 (2024)  offers a great set of specs for the price, delivering excellent performance, a bright display, and a sleek design that make it an easy recommendation for Windows users.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You want a powerful Windows laptop:  Just because it\u2019s under $1,000 doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t also pack a punch. This laptop delivered an impressive Geekbench 6 performance score, and stood up to real-world tests incredibly well.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You\u2019re a port fiend:  The Acer Swift Go 14 has a wonderful array of ports, with two Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, a USB-A port, and an HDMI 2.1 port on the left and a USB-A port, an audio jack, and a microSD card slot on the right.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You\u2019re looking for fantastic battery life:  This laptop\u2019s battery life of 8 hours and 25 minutes isn\u2019t necessarily bad, but we\u2019ve seen other Windows laptops recently boast over 15 to 16 hours of battery life.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You don\u2019t want to use an external mouse:  The Acer Swift Go 14 has a great keyboard, but its trackpad is sluggish and difficult to use. So if you don\u2019t want to use a wired or wireless mouse with this laptop, maybe avoid it.\n\nAcer's Swift Go 14 ushers in a new era with impressive AI capabilities. Gone are the days of lackluster integrated graphics \u2014 the Swift Go's Arc GPU tackles most tasks effortlessly while its NPU optimizes performance for a seamless user experience.\n\nThe GPU and NPU power results in smooth 4K video editing, even unplugged, making it a compelling alternative to the pricier MacBook Air M2. Even in our lab, the Acer Swift Go 14 achieved a multi-core average of 11,815 on the Geekbench 5.5 overall performance test. That put the Macbook Air M2 and  Macbook Pro  13 M2 to shame, with the M2's score being 8,919.\n\nThe Swift Go 14 improved over last year\u2019s entry, netting an additional 2 hours of battery life for 9 hours and 50 minutes. It\u2019s not the best, but it lasts a whole work or school day. Its 14-inch, WUXGA (1920 x 1200) resolution touch display is no joke. It covered 79.1 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut and averaged 374 nits of brightness. That\u2019s vibrant as hell for a laptop at this price.\n\nYou may or may not know this, but laptop webcams suck. Not this one, though. The Swift Go 14\u2019s QHD (2560 x 1440) webcam is excellent. You get improved image quality thanks to the high resolution and Acer\u2019s included AI tools.\n\nAll that is packed into a sturdy aluminum build, which weighs 2.9 pounds and measures 12.32 x 8.58 x 0.68 inches. Budget laptops can get a little chunky, so it\u2019s refreshing to see a machine that looks good and is highly portable.\n\nWith its powerful performance, ample storage, affordability, and top-notch webcam, the Swift Go 14 emerges as a serious contender for budget-conscious students, creators, and professionals on the move.\n\nSee our full  Acer Swift Go 14 review .\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe  Acer Nitro 17  is a budget-friendly powerhouse with fantastic overall performance and gaming performance, a huge 17.3-inch display with a 165Hz refresh rate, and a great set of speakers.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You want a smooth gaming experience:  The best reason to buy the Acer Nitro 17 is if you want a powerful gaming experience that\u2019s also affordable. It\u2019s equipped with a great CPU and GPU and plenty of RAM and storage.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You want great built-in audio:  Laptop speakers generally aren\u2019t great, but this laptop\u2019s speakers sound fantastic, so if you don\u2019t want to use headphones while you play games, the Acer Nitro 17 is a smart pick.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You need a laptop that\u2019ll last away from an outlet:  Gaming laptops simply don\u2019t have great battery life because of their powerful internals. This laptop only lasted 7 hours and 22 minutes on our web-surfing battery life test.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You want an easily portable laptop:  By definition, all laptops are technically portable. But with this laptop\u2019s 17.3-inch display and 6.8-pound weight, it\u2019s not the best travel companion.\n\nThe Acer Nitro 17 is a wildly impressive gaming laptop at its price. With smooth gaming performance powered by a Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU, excellent overall performance thanks to an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, a large and good-looking display, great audio quality, and a comfortable, RGB backlit keyboard, you\u2019d expect this portable gaming machine to be much more expensive.\n\nStevie Bonifield writes, \u201cfor those who only want a desktop  or  a laptop for gaming, the Nitro 17 is a fantastic option and it may even be a worthy replacement for older or underpowered desktop gaming PCs.\u201d This hefty gaming laptop may not necessarily have the most powerful specs and it may not be able to run your favorite AAA games at max settings, but for the price, the Nitro 17 can\u2019t be beat.\n\nLooking at overall performance first, the Nitro 17 earned a Geekbench 6 multi-core score of 12,358 and managed to transfer 25GB of files at 1,844 Mbps. When tackling daily tasks like web browsing and word processing, the laptop breezed through. At its hottest point under pressure, the max temperature reached on the laptop was only 91.5 degrees, below our comfort threshold of 95 degrees.\n\nOn the 3DMark FireStrike benchmark, the Acer Nitro 17 notched a score of 24,422. Then, in our  Borderlands 3  benchmark at 1080p, the laptop averaged 84 frames per second. When playing less graphically intensive games, like  Starfield  and  Roboquest , the Nitro 17 sailed on smoothly with no lag, glitches, or freezing.\n\nWith such excellent performance, the Nitro 17 does falter in the battery life category. On our web-surfing battery life test, this laptop only lasted 7 hours and 22 minutes, which is pretty decent for a gaming laptop, but not on par with non-gaming Windows laptops. Plus, its internals make the overall rig quite heavy at 6.8 pounds.\n\nIf you plan to have the Nitro 17 plugged in at all times in a fairly permanent spot in your home, then you won\u2019t even have to worry about its poor battery life and hefty form factor.\n\nSee our full  Acer Nitro 17 review .\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe  Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus  offers solid performance, decent battery life, and that sought-after thin, lightweight form factor. Plus, it has a gorgeous 15.6-inch AMOLED display that you usually won\u2019t find in Chromebooks.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You want a stunning display:  If you plan to watch a lot of content on your laptop, you\u2019ll love the Galaxy Chromebook Plus\u2019 bright, vivid 15.6-inch, 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You\u2019re looking for an all-day battery life:  Chromebooks aren\u2019t known for having the best battery life, but this laptop lasted an impressive 11 hours and 12 minutes on our web-surfing battery life test.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You don't like ChromeOS:  This laptop has a lot of positive features, but it does run ChromeOS. If you need specific Windows apps or programs that don't mesh well with ChromeOS, this laptop may not be the best fit.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You want a laptop with a more portable 13- or 14-inch display:  This laptop is incredibly light at 2.5 pounds, but it does have a 15.6-inch display. You can find something smaller (and likely lighter) if that\u2019s an important factor for you.\n\nYou can find cheaper Chromebooks out there, but you won\u2019t find any that are quite as great a value as the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus. Many Chromebooks offer dull displays, middling performance, and poor battery life, but the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is a breath of fresh air, with a stellar, large display, impressive tab-hoarding capabilities, and a battery that lasted over 11 hours.\n\nPerhaps the Galaxy Chromebook Plus\u2019 most impressive feature is its display, which isn\u2019t surprising seeing as it\u2019s made by Samsung. James Pero says this laptop\u2019s 15.6-inch, 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display is \u201cfairly dynamic and plenty bright, especially if you're using it for what most people might use a Chromebook for \u2014 general web browsing and YouTube viewing or maybe the occasional movie.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting this laptop covers a whopping 108.5% of the DCI-P3 color gamut.\n\nMoving on to performance, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus earned a multi-core score of 6,016 on the Geekbench 6 benchmark, which is about half of what we typically see from a non-Chromebook laptop. With about a dozen tabs open, including YouTube, this laptop performed well, with no lag and fast page-loading times.\n\nThis laptop also has a surprisingly wide array of ports for how thin and lightweight it is. On the left side, there are two USB-C ports and an HDMI port. On the right, you\u2019ll find a USB-A port, a microSD card slot, and an audio jack.\n\nDespite this laptop\u2019s larger-than-average, AMOLED display and great performance results, it lasted quite a while on our web-surfing battery life test. It\u2019s not uncommon to see Chromebooks die before hitting the 10-hour mark, but the Galaxy Chromebook Plus lasted 11 hours and 12 minutes.\n\nSee our full  Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus review .\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nOur expert review:\n\nThe  Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 5  is an ideal pick for business users because it\u2019s easy to travel with, offers great performance, and features a lovely keyboard with the famous TrackPoint dot.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You\u2019re looking for a travel-friendly laptop:  With a 14-inch display, a low 3.3-pound weight, and a durable design, the ThinkPad E14 is a great choice to bring on flights or on multi-day road trips.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f  You\u2019d like great features in addition to performance:  While this laptop\u2019s shining feature may be its performance-to-price ratio, it also features a bright display, decent audio, and a good webcam.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You want a laptop with exceptional battery life:  This laptop lasted only 7 hours and 48 minutes on our battery life test. If you need more juice than that, opt for a different laptop.\n\n\u2716\ufe0f  You plan on using your laptop to play games or edit videos:  The ThinkPad E14 is great for everyday productivity tasks, but it doesn\u2019t have the graphics prowess to handle anything more than cloud games on a good day.\n\nWith people returning to the office and traveling for work, the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 5 is perfectly positioned to take center stage in this new hybrid work landscape.\n\nThis portable workhorse is an ideal travel companion thanks to its MIL-STD 810H certification, which proved that it can withstand the average drops and tumbles on top of extreme temperatures, dust, shocks, and more. Its IR camera, webcam shutter, and fingerprint sensor make it less susceptible to security breaches.\n\nOn the performance side, the ThinkPad E14 is packing an Intel Core i7-1355U processor, which scored 8,000 on the Geekbench 6 overall performance test, beating the average laptop in its category at the time of the review. Its 512GB SSD is also quite speedy, clocking in at 1,258 megabytes per second.\n\nI love it when a display brightens my day \u2014 the ThinkPad\u2019s 14-inch, WUXGA (1920 x 1200) resolution touch display averaged 366 nits of brightness. However, there are a few clouds in the forecast, as the panel covered a measly 46.3 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. That means the display is half as colorful as the average laptop in its category.\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the ThinkPad brand, you\u2019d know how famously comfortable its keyboards are. The ThinkPad E14 is no different, boasting a super responsive keyboard with excellent bounce. The spacing between the keys is great, and the pointing stick users will be satisfied knowing this machine has the nub.\n\nHowever, a big drawback for business users is its battery life. The ThinkPad E14 lasted only 7 hours and 48 minutes on a single charge. That almost completes a workday but won\u2019t get you over the finish line. As long as you\u2019re okay with reaching for a charger at the end of the day, the Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 5 is a great business laptop.\n\nSee our full  Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 5 review .\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThere's a lot to consider when shopping for one of the best laptops under $1,000. Here's a good breakdown of how to find the best laptop for you.\n\nWhat's your budget?\n\nSure, you can find some diamond-in-the-rough Windows laptops and  Chromebooks  among the  best laptops under $500 , but you may have to deal with a low-performing CPU or a poor multitasker. If you're a light laptop user, those will be OK, but if you need something more powerful, aim higher \u2014 the base model for some of the best mainstream laptops start between $800-$1,000, so you'll make some trade-offs, but there are outstanding options for most people in this range.\n\nDo you want a 2-in-1 or a clamshell?\n\nIf you enjoy the awesomeness of converting your laptop into a tablet, the  best 2-in-1 laptops  are a good choice. Just keep in mind that a traditional laptop usually has a lower price and stronger-performing features.\n\nHow much battery life do you need?\n\nIf you're on the go, you'll need to s", "excerpt": "These are the best budget laptops for your wallet\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.
